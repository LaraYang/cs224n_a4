You know what I do is write for the kids , and in fact , I 'm probably the author for children , the more read in the U.S .
And I always tell people that I do n't want to look like a scientist .
I can wear as a farmer , or with leather clothes , and never ever elected a farmer .
I 'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk> .
And you know that a <unk> is usually something that fell to you somewhere .
You just have to turn on the block to see it as an epiphany .
That 's the painting of a circle .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> .
It 's the kind of complicated circle that I 'm going to talk about .
My circle started in the 1960s average school , in <unk> , Ohio where I was the rare class .
When they were beaten up to bleed every week in the kids ' bathroom , until a teacher saved me life .
She saved my life when she saved the teachers ' room .
I made it secret .
For three years .
And I had to go from the city .
I had a thumb , and 85 dollars , and I ended up in San Francisco , California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1980s , I felt the need to start working in organizations who fought against AIDS .
About three or four years ago , half of the night I got a phone call from the teacher , the <unk> lady who said , `` I need to see you .
I 'm up with our adults never to know us .
You could <unk> Ohio , and then it brings that man that I know you already found .
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer , and I 'd like you to join me with this please . ''
Well , the next day we were in Cleveland .
We went to see , we laugh , we cried , and we realized that she needed to be <unk> .
We found a place , the <unk> , and the <unk> and we care about their family , because it was necessary .
It 's something we knew how to do .
And as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult came to me , he became a <unk> box and he was put in my hands .
And what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was present in itself .
<unk> is that death is part of life .
She saved my life , my partner and I save her .
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
It needs true and beauty , and I 'm very happy that I talked a lot about this .
It also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it 's our job to provide those things .
Thank you .
As an artist , the connection is very important for me .
Through my work , I 'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected .
I went for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago , and I saw my first <unk> .
I was amazed .
My heart can quickly , I was <unk> , trying to understand what I was in front of me .
They 're <unk> around my water nearly 60 meters , and I could n't even more think that it was a snowflake about a <unk> on another <unk> year after year .
<unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or the ice walls .
Each iceberg has its own individual personality .
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
Some people refuse to give up and they hold up to the end , while others ca n't stand it more and they were <unk> in a dramatic passion .
It 's easy to think , by seeing a eardrum , that they are isolated apart from each of us , as we see ourselves sometimes as humans .
But reality is the opposite .
As a iceberg melts , I 'm breathing his ancestral atmosphere .
As a iceberg melts , it releases rich water , in minerals that feeds many forms of life .
I walk to photograph these <unk> as if it were about the portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these unique moments , there are only that way and wo n't exist again again .
It 's not the death when you fire down ; it 's not an end , but a continuation of its path for the life cycle .
Now , part of the ice ice I 'm photographing is very young -- it 's got a couple thousand years .
And another piece of the ice has over 100,000 years .
The last pictures I 'd like to show you are the iceberg I photographed in <unk> , Greenland .
It 's a little bit often to actually see a rolling iceberg .
Here they have .
You can see the left one little boat .
It 's about five meters .
And I 'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line .
You can see here , it starts to roll , the ship has moved on the other side and the man is standing there .
This is a Greenland ticket , average size .
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 meters .
This video is in real time .
And so <unk> , the eardrum shows a different side of your personality .
Thank you .
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979 , the same day , exactly at the same time , every single <unk> a baby . Okay .
So , two couples each with a baby .
I do n't want you to stop too much in the details of conception , because if you stop thinking about conception , you 're not going to pay attention .
Let 's think about that for a moment .
And on this stage , I want you to imagine that in one case , the sperm chromosome gets together into the X X chromosome .
And in the other case , the X X chromosome is joins into the X X chromosome .
Both turn on and starts life .
We 'll go back to talk about them later .
In my ground activity to be two roles .
In one of my roles , I work with the story of anatomy .
I 'm <unk> for training , and what I study in this case is the way people came up with anatomy -- this is , in human bodies and <unk> , how they 've considered body fluids , the idea of the body , what have you thought about about the body .
The other role that performance in my work is the one of an activist , as a patient advocate , or as I say sometimes , women 's talented women who are medical patients .
In this case , I 've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms .
I 've been working , for example , with <unk> twins , two people within one body .
I 've worked with people with <unk> ; people are much lower than the average .
And I 've been working with many cases of people with atypical sex , individuals whose physical typology of the physical typology do n't fit into male <unk> and conventional women .
In the general lines , we can call it <unk> .
<unk> takes a lot of ways .
I 'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that does n't fit in the male 's ordinary or female forms .
For example , there 's the case of the individual with <unk> XY gene , which is the <unk> gene to the chromosome , and it says to the <unk> , that we all have in the fetal life , which become testicles .
And then in the fetal life , the testes make testosterone testosterone .
But because this individual has lacks testosterone receptors , the body does not react to the same .
This is <unk> syndrome .
So , there are high testosterone levels , but no reaction .
As a result , the body develops to a <unk> course .
When you 're born , the baby looks like a child .
It 's a girl . She 's raised as a child .
And so often , it 's not until the puberty , when it 's growing up and developing breast , but it does n't have the menstrual period , when someone realizes something 's going on .
After doing tests realize that instead of having ovaries and uterus actually have testicles and chromosome .
The important thing to understand is that you might think it 's a man , but it 's actually not that way .
Women , like men , have the body something called <unk> glands .
They 're in the back of the body .
<unk> glands produce <unk> , the <unk> hormone .
Most of the women like me -- I consider a typical woman ; it does n't know his <unk> structure ; I think I 'm a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk> .
We 're producing <unk> and we respond to the <unk> .
As a result , someone like me has the brain more exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who had <unk> syndrome .
So sex is a complicated thing . It 's not that <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a certain way they can be everywhere .
Another example : a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old boy who was born and raised as a male , he had a girlfriend , and she had sex , and she was wearing a life as a guy , and I had just discovered I had ovaries and uterus .
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It had the 20th chromosomes , and in the womb <unk> glands were so active that they were essentially creating a male hormone environment .
As a result , their genitals were <unk> , their brain was exposed to the hormone component of <unk> male .
He was born as a child -- no one <unk> anything .
And it was at the age of 19 , when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal menstruation , when doctors found that , in fact , she was a woman inside .
Well , another quick example of <unk> .
Some people with the 20th , they develop what 's called <unk> , which is to say , have a <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue .
We do n't know what that happens .
So , there are many varieties of sex .
The reason for children with these kinds of bodies -- it would be <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , they 're <unk> , <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health .
In many cases , people are perfectly healthy .
The reason they go through several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories .
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings to a particular identity .
We have the idea that being a woman is to have female identity -- supposedly , black means to say African anatomy in historical terms .
A terribly simplistic idea .
And when you show us a body that shows something quite different , we have problems with <unk> .
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture about it .
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic <unk> .
Imagine how surprising it is to have children that are born as two people within a body .
The most high point is last year with the South African corridor , <unk> <unk> ; he got in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in Berlin .
A lot of reporters called myself to ask myself , `` What exam are you going to do to determine whether or <unk> is a man or a woman ? ''
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such exam .
In fact , now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature does n't trace a line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> -- we are us who draw that line .
So , what we have is a situation where the further science advances , more we need to admit that these categories were , we 've been able to find a little stable mental categories that were activated directly with <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than we thought .
And it 's not just in terms of sex .
Also in terms of race , something that happens far more complicated than the terminology allows .
As we see , we put in a rough terrain .
So , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps .
What about the fact that it 's made of <unk> in just a few nucleotides ?
And as we moved in science , we get more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that simplistic categories that <unk> are probably too simplistic .
And we 're looking at this in all walks of human life .
One of them , for example , in our current culture , in the United States today , are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life .
It 's hard to fix a moment from which one body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk> .
There are very heated discussions today in the audience , but I know within the <unk> of when someone is considered dead .
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead .
As a lot of her , they got a pen in front of his nose , and he moved not yet to <unk> it .
If you stopped moving it down .
But today , we can , for example , extract life from a body and put them in another body .
And as a result , we have to deal with the dilemma of the dilemma of really understanding somebody 's death , and this puts us in a hard situation where we do n't have the single categories of the past .
And you might think that this fabric explosion could be happy to someone like me .
In politics I 'm progressive , I claim to people with unusual bodies , but I have to admit that I 'm getting nervous .
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were <unk> .
It 's <unk> from the concept of democracy .
And to tell you about this tension first , I have to admit that I 'm a fervent fan of the Parents .
I know they were racist , I know they were <unk> , but they were big .
I mean , they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did , that I find each so much watching that <unk> , `` 1776 , '' and not the music , which is totally <unk> .
It 's what happened in 1776 with the Founding Parents .
Parents know were , for me , the first <unk> activists and explain why .
What they would reject was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which it was radical and beautiful , and it was kept for 200 years .
And , as you all remember , what I anticipated our Founding Founding was the idea of the monarchy , the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
The monarchs of the old world did n't know the DNA , but they had clear the idea of birth .
They had the concept of blue blood .
They were from the idea that it was coming into political power by the right of blood transmitted from the grandfather to the father and then the child and so on .
Parents know that idea was rejected by the idea and replaced it by a new <unk> concept , and that concept was that all men are created equal .
They <unk> the field of play , and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the anatomical differences . That was very radical .
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were happening .
The democracy was happening and at the same time was born science .
And it 's very clear , if you look at the history of fathers ' history , that many were very interested in science and the idea of a naturalist world .
They were <unk> of supernatural explanations , and thereby rejected the concept of supernatural power on a vague idea of birth .
They were moving into a naturalist concept .
And if you look at , for example , the Declaration of Independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
They do n't talk about God and the nature of God .
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
And the consequence was passing the idea of <unk> coincidence .
And by doing that , they were laid the foundations of the Civil Rights movement .
They did n't think about it , but they did it for us and it was great .
And what happened years later ?
And women succeeded .
And then the Civil Rights Movement came to the Civil Rights Movement with people of <unk> <unk> , who said , `` I 'm not a woman ? ''
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying , `` I 'm a man . ''
Again , people of color that are <unk> on the <unk> difference and , again , succeeded .
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement .
The problem is , of course , that as we look at our coincidences , we have to start asking why we keep certain divisions .
But , attention , I want to keep some Asian divisions in our culture .
For example , I do n't want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
I do n't want to say that we had to <unk> ourselves in the anatomy .
I do n't want to say that at the age of five , they should have sex or marry .
There are some Asian divisions that for me make sense , and I think we should maintain .
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are , why keep them and make sense .
Well , let 's go back to those two metrics to the beginning of this talk .
We have two beings , both purposes of 1979 exactly the same day .
Imagine that one of them , Mary , was born three months before , June 1 , 1980 .
Henry , on the contrary , was born in a term : the March 1 , 1980 .
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to Henry 's consent , the right to vote , the right to <unk> .
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age , but because it was born later .
We found other oddities in relation to their rights .
Henry , by virtue of being considered a man -- if I did n't tell you if it 's <unk> , by virtue of being considered a man now , the mandatory <unk> of Mary does n't have to worry .
Mary , for his part , does not have the same rights to marriage than Henry in all states , for example .
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman , but Mary can marry a woman only in some states .
So still persist categories anatomy that in a number of ways are solved and questionable .
And now the question is : What do we do now that science went forward both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could crumble ?
I do n't want to give up science , but at the same time , I feel like science is getting away .
Where do we go ?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude : `` Well , we need to draw the line somewhere , so we 're going to do it . ''
But a lot of people are trapped in a rare position .
For example , Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man , you do n't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman , you have to have chromosome .
Now , in practice , they do n't do <unk> tests .
But this is also very strange , given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome .
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Luther King , in his `` I Have a dream , '' offers a solution .
He says that we should judge people based on not the color of their skin , but in the content of their character , going beyond anatomy .
And I mean , `` Yes , the idea looks very good . ''
But in practice , how do you do ?
How do you judge people based on the content of their character ?
I want to point out that I 'm not sure that I 'm not sure that we should be involved in this to <unk> rights to people , because I admit I know about some <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know .
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more informed , smart , mature decisions about their sex relationships than people from 40 I know .
So how do you put the subject of character content ?
It 's very difficult .
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of one person could in the future will be measured with an instrument , maybe with an MRI .
Do we really want to get to that point ?
I 'm not sure where we go .
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this thought of thinking about the issue of democracy .
We 've done a good job in defense of democracy , and I think we 're going to do good work in the future .
We do n't live , for example , in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> , unless he 's willing to keep a sex shift in which case it allows you to live .
We 're not in that situation .
I 'm glad to say that we do n't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I 'd made to give birth twins to <unk> , and then pick them up and so forth .
But when the phone asked him the reason for the operation of the operation , he was a very <unk> operation , he said that in that other country these kids would be very abused and therefore I had to .
I said , `` Well , he 's considered political asylum instead of <unk> separation ? ''
The United States offers enormous possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the state of the state .
So I think we have to be on your head .
Well , in closing I mean I 've been talking a lot about Parents .
And I want to think about what democracy would be , or as it might have been , if we had given the moms .
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different anatomy in particular if there are people thinking about group .
For years , since I 've been interested in <unk> , I 've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference .
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world .
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women , on average , not all , but they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships , and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group .
And if we think about that , we have an interesting situation in our hands .
Now , when I was in graduate , one of my advisors , one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I considered myself feminist , as I did a strange question .
`` Tell me what feminism has for me . ''
And I thought , `` It 's the dumbest question I 've ever heard .
Feminism has to do with rid of gender stereotypes , so there 's nothing women of feminism . ''
But the more I 've thought about his question , more of me have seemed like there 's a little female in feminism .
I mean , there might be something , on average , something different from the feminine brain and the male that makes us more <unk> into complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable .
So while the parents were very attentive to find out the way to protect people from the state , it 's possible that , to have more Mothers with this concept , we might have enriched the concept of protection with reciprocal support .
And maybe that 's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond the anatomy , to think less about the individual body , in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
So as we try to create a more perfect union , let 's think about what we do for each other .
Thank you .
In 2007 , I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development .
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work , it has the ability to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents .
Well , right now , we 're far away from that goal .
There are billions of people in developing countries that do n't do with a single city just willing to get around .
But the amazing thing about cities is that it 's worth much more than their cost of construction .
So we could easily go to the world , tens , maybe hundreds of new cities .
Well , this may sound absurd if you 've never thought about new cities .
But just <unk> by apartment buildings .
Imagine that half of you who wanted to live in apartments already are owners , and that in the other half still wo n't stop it .
You could try to increase the capacity by doing <unk> in all the buildings .
But you know the problem that you 're going to argue is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid discomfort and distractions .
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk> .
But they could go to a whole new place , build a whole new apartment building , always , and when the rules of that place , we 're going to build it instead of shipping .
So I proposed that governments would develop new enough to contain cities and gave them a name , under charter cities .
I later found out that more or less at the same time , <unk> and <unk> were thinking about a challenge for Honduras .
They knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> will come out of their country to go to the United States , and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras .
In the summer of 2009 , Honduras went through a harrowing constitutional crisis .
In the following regular elections , <unk> <unk> became <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a platform in which reforms and the same time as reconciliation .
He asked <unk> to be his head of cabinet .
Meanwhile , I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal .
Through a process of refinement , trial and error , and a huge amount of evidence with users , tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under charter to their most essential ideas .
The first point was the importance of norms , like those norms that they say you ca n't go and do n't hear all the current residents of apartments .
It 's a lot of attention to new technologies , but you need so much of technologies like norms to make progress , and usually the rules that keep us out of progress .
In the fall of 2010 , a friend of Guatemala sent him a link with a TEDTalk .
He showed him to <unk> .
They called me .
They said , `` <unk> this to the leaders of our country . ''
So in December we came together in Miami in a hotel conference room .
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are , much more valuable than its monetary cost .
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York , look , land that , in some cases , are worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
But it was a pretty abstract discussion , and at some point , when there was a pause , he said , `` Paul , maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk . ''
And the talk described to me in very simple terms that a low charter city is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain , a charter that specific rules will be used there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms .
So the president of Honduras called me , and he told me that we had to do this project , this is important , this could be the path for our country forward .
He asked me to go and talk again about four and five of January .
So I came up with another talk full of data , which included an image like this , which was to explain that to make a lot of value to a city , this has to be very big .
This is a picture of Denver , and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denver .
Just this airport covers over 100 square kilometers .
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city , you have to start with a place which is about 3,000 square kilometers .
That 's over 100,000 hectares .
Everybody <unk> politely .
The faces of the public were really serious and attentive .
The leader of Congress came to the platform and said , `` Professor <unk> , thank you very much for his talk , but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk .
I 've got it here in my computer . ''
So I sat down and they showed the TEDTalk .
And this explained the essentials -- that a new city can offer new choices for people .
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to be in Honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away to the North .
And also <unk> new choices for leaders .
Because the leaders of the government of Honduras would need help from countries associated , they could benefit from countries associated with them to establish and do to deliver the charter rules , so that they could all trust that the charter of effectively is transformed .
We went and saw a site .
This picture is there .
It could easily cover a thousand square kilometers .
And little after , the 19th of January , they voted in Congress to <unk> its Constitution , and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow you to create these special regions of development .
In a country that was just going through this painful crisis , the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was <unk> .
All parties , all the factions in society , the <unk> .
To <unk> in the Constitution , you have to pass twice in Congress .
February 17th , February 17th , again , there was another voting on the other vote .
Immediately after the voting , the 21st to February 24 , a delegation of 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities .
One of them is South Korea .
This is a picture of a new <unk> of the city that 's being built in South Korea ; it 's bigger than the Boston center .
Everything you see there was built in four years , after four years , getting permits .
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore .
In fact , they 've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third .
And if you think about this in practical ways , this is the point where we are .
They have a place , and they 're already thinking about a site for the second city .
They 're preparing a legal system to allow the administrators to come from , and at the same time would enable the <unk> under an external legal system .
A country has already committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the last breakdown for this new judicial system .
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project .
They can even get some funding .
But the only thing that we know that they 've already figured out is that they have a good number of inhabitants .
There are many companies that wanted to be installed in the Americas , especially in a place with a <unk> zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there .
In the world , there are 700 million people who say they 'd like to change immediately another place .
There 's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States .
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to get a job ; sometimes they 're single mothers who have to make their money so just eating or buy clothes .
Unfortunately , there are sometimes kids who are trying to meet with their parents who have n't seen , in some cases , in a decade .
So what do you think about building a new city in Honduras ?
Or do you build a dozen of these , or a hundred , all around the world ?
What does it seem to think about insist that families can choose between several cities that are competing for attracting new residents ?
This is an idea worth spreading .
And my friends were asked to say , `` Thank you TED . ''
I 'm a <unk> , and this is my <unk> .
But before I show you what 's inside , I 'm going to make a public confession , and it 's that I live obsessed with suits .
I love to find , I 'm wearing , and more recently , photograph and publish my blog and bold , colorful , different and different , for every time .
But I do n't buy anything new .
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and second hand stores .
Ah , thank you .
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my wallet .
I go to know people <unk> , usually my money goes to a good cause ; my thing is unique ; and buy it becomes my personal search for treasures .
I mean , what am I going to find today ?
Is it my stature ?
I 'm going to like the color ?
Will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
If all the answers are positive , then I feel that I 've won .
Now , back to the theme of my <unk> , I want to tell you what I packed up for this exciting week at TED .
I mean , what does it bring with somebody who has all that clothes ?
So I 'm going to show you exactly what I brought in .
I brought seven pairs of underwear , and nothing else .
And the interior exchange for exactly a week is everything I 've put in my <unk> .
I figured it would be able to find everything else I 'd like to use after coming here to Palm Springs .
And because they do n't know me as the woman who walks by TED in underwear , that means I found some things .
And I 'd like to show you now the sets of sets for this week .
Does n't sound interesting ?
While I do it , I 'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not , I 've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes .
Let 's start with Sunday .
I call this brilliant tiger .
You do n't have to spend a lot of money to look good .
You can almost always see it just phenomenal for less than 50 dollars .
The whole set , including the jacket , and I 've got 55 , and it 's the most expensive thing I 've used in the week .
Monday : the color is energy .
It 's almost <unk> physiologically , when you 're wearing a bright red pants .
If you 're happy , you 're going to attract other people happy .
Tuesday : The integration is <unk> .
I 've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time .
I just know yourself .
If you 're going to get rid of the right people , you wo n't just understand you , you 're going to get <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> of the child taking inside .
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the costumes , or I remind you of their <unk> .
I like <unk> and say , `` Thank you . ''
Thursday : Trust is the key .
If you think you 're looking good at something , it 's almost safe to be .
And if you think you do n't see you well with something , it 's probably true .
My mother taught me this day after day .
But it was n't until the 30 years I really understood what it means .
And I 'm going to explain it in a few seconds .
If you think you 're a beautiful person in your interior and outside , you do n't look at you ca n't attract it .
So there 's no excuse for anybody in this audience .
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve .
Thank you .
<unk> : A universal truth six words for you : The golden <unk> go with everything .
And finally , Saturday : Developing a personal , unique style of telling the world something about you without having to say a word .
I 've tried it over and over again when people came up to me this week , just by what I was using . And we had fantastic conversations .
Obviously this is n't going to go into my little <unk> .
So before I left home , to Brooklyn , I 'm going to donate everything .
Because the lesson I 'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave certain things behind .
I do n't need to <unk> these things , because back around the corner , there will always be another crazy , colorful suit , if there 's a little bit of love in my heart and look for it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts .
The left side , which is the logic , and the right side , which is the intuitive part .
So , if you take a scale to measure the fitness in every hemisphere , we could design a blueprint of our brain .
For example , this would be somebody who is completely logical .
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive .
So , where do you choose your brain on this scale ?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes , but I think that for most of the members of this audience , their brain is something like this -- with a great fitness in both hemispheres .
It 's not that they 're mutually exclusive .
You can be logical and intuitive .
I consider myself one of those people , like most other quantum quantum physicists , we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas .
But at the same time , we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work .
How do we develop this intuition ? Well , we like to play with things .
We 're playing with them and then we see how they react , and then we develop our intuition to that point .
And actually , you do the same thing .
So a little intuition that you may have developed with the age of the years is that one thing can be just in a place at a time .
I mean , it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but you did n't work out with this notion , the whole notion of it .
I remember looking at a child playing in a car park .
It was a little kid , and he did n't do it very well , it always was falling .
But I bet the playing with that parking lot has taught him a valuable lesson , and it is that big things do n't allow them to <unk> them , and that they stay in a place .
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world , except be a particle physicist .
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they do n't play parking with parking lot , they 're playing with these strange little particles .
And when they play with their particles , they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- as they can go through walls , or that they may be in two different places at the same time .
And then they wrote all these observations , and they called the quantum mechanics theory .
At that point , it was the physics of a few years ago -- you needed about quantum mechanics to describe those little particles .
But they did n't need to describe the big objects around us every day .
That did n't fit very well to my intuition , and maybe it 's because I do n't play very often with particles .
Well , sometimes play with them , but not very much .
And I 've never seen it .
I mean , no one saw a particle .
But it did n't fit back to my logic .
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics , then should n't it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics ?
I do n't find the reason why I should n't .
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics .
That 's why a few years ago , I proposed to do exactly that .
And I did .
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics .
What we see here is a little computer chip .
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle .
That 's the little metal that I 'm going to talk about in a minute .
This is a picture of the object .
And here I 'm going to extend it a little bit . It 's right at the center .
And then here we 're doing a good approach to the little <unk> of metal .
What we see is a little bit of metal , with a springboard a springboard and that he 's driven in a platform .
And then I did this almost the same way that you would make a computer chip .
I went to a clean room with a fresh silicon chip chip , and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours .
For the last material , I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a <unk> fashion that is underneath the device .
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap , but it needs a bit of help .
Let me make an analogy .
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people .
I mean , when I 'm on an elevator , I do all kinds of weird things , but then when other people go up and do those things , because I do n't bother you , or really frightening .
Quantum mechanics says the inanimate objects behave in the same way .
The journey on the voyage of inanimate objects are not just people , it 's also the light that shines it and the wind passing on and the heat of the room .
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics , we would have to <unk> all the other passengers .
And that 's what we did .
<unk> the lights , then we introduced a vacuuming , and we pulled out all the air , and then we cool it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero .
Now , when you 're just on the elevator , the little piece of metal is free to act as you want .
So we measured its movement .
We discovered he moved in very strange ways .
Instead of staying perfectly still , it was vibrating , and the way it was like a breath of this shape -- like a <unk> that 's expanding and contracts .
And by giving it a smooth lift , we were able to make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics .
So what I 'm telling you is something really fantastic .
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time ?
Let 's think of atoms .
In one case , all the trillions of atoms that make up that kind of metal are still , and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
It 's just in certain brief points when those line line up .
Over the rest of the time they are <unk> .
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which at the time means that all the whole metal piece is in two different places .
I think this is great .
Seriously .
But it was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of these years , because , look at this , the difference on scale between one single atom , and that little bit of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you .
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time , and that piece of metal can be in two different places , why do n't you ?
I mean , it 's my logic that speaks .
So imagine if they were in a number of places at the same time , what would that be ?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space ?
There 's another part of the story .
And it 's when we heat it up , and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box , we saw that the metal was still there in one piece .
And I could get to this new intuition , apparently all of the objects in the elevator actually are quantum objects that are just spinning into a small space .
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims it 's all interconnected .
Well , that 's not so true .
It 's more than that , it 's deeper .
It 's that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that 's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics .
Thank you .
My name is <unk> .
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google , until I launched the idea of doing something related to the museums and art to my boss that it 's here and that allowed me to take it out .
It took me 18 months .
Many negotiations and stories , I assure you , with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries .
But I 'm going to focus on the demo .
There 's a lot of stories about why we did .
I think my own story is simply explaining to this slide , and this is the access .
I grew up in India .
<unk> of a great education -- I did n't bother myself , but I did n't have access to many of these museums and artwork .
So when I started traveling and go to museums , I started to learn a lot .
And working on Google , I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology .
So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing it .
So let me just show you a couple of interesting things that we 've been doing since their launch .
So , simply , we 're going to <unk> .
Look around all the museums there are .
There 's the <unk> gallery , the MoMA , the <unk> , the <unk> , Van Gogh .
I 'm actually going to get in one of my favorites , to the <unk> , the art museum in New York .
There are two ways to do that -- very simple .
We click and , <unk> ! We 're already inside the museum .
No matter where they are , Mumbai or <unk> , that does n't really matter .
You move around and they have fun .
Do you want to navigate the museum ?
We opened up the blueprint , and , with one click , we jumped inside .
You 're inside , you want to go at the end of the hallway .
They go ahead and go ahead .
<unk> .
Thank you , but I have n't reached the best .
Now I 'm in front of one of my favorite paintings , `` The <unk> '' of Pieter <unk> in the <unk> .
I see a sign .
If the museum shows us the image , we click there .
Look , this is one of the images .
Here 's all the information that 's metadata .
For those of you who are really interested in art , you can click there , but I 'm going to click here right now .
And this is one of the images that we 've captured in what we call the <unk> technology .
So this image , for example , contains , I think , about 10,000 million pixels .
And there are many people who ask me , `` What do you get with 10,000 million pixels ? ''
So I 'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels .
It can zoom in around a very simple way .
You see fun things that are happening .
I love this guy , his expression has no price .
But if you really want to go into it .
So I started playing , and I found something that was happening there .
And I said , `` Wait a moment , this seems interesting . ''
I went into and discovered that the kids were actually playing something .
And I did a little bit , I talked to some people from the <unk> , and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> , which is hitting a <unk> with a Carnival stick .
And apparently it was very popular .
I do n't know why they did it , but I 've learned something about it .
And now we 're going to get down further and you 'll see that you can actually get the cracks .
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective , I 'm going to remove the picture , so you 'll see what there is .
This is where we were , and this is the painting .
The best thing is to come , a second .
So now we 're very quickly going to jump at MoMA in New York City .
Here 's another one of my favorites , `` The night <unk> . ''
The example I showed you was to find details .
But what if you want to see the <unk> ?
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
It goes up and really does it .
I go to one of my favorite parts in this picture , and I 'm really going to get to the cracks .
This is `` <unk> night , '' I think I 'd never seen it before .
I 'm going to show you another one of my favorite features .
There are lots of things more here , but I do n't have time to show it .
This is the really cool part . It 's called `` <unk> . ''
All of you , absolutely all , does n't matter whether it 's rich or poor , or if you have a mansion , that 's the same thing .
You can online to create your own museum , create your own collection from all these images .
It 's very simple , we enter this function that I call `` The <unk> . ''
It 's `` <unk> '' at the National Gallery in London .
You can write things out , send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you 're feeling at contemplating these master works .
So in conclusion , I think that for me , the main thing is that all incredible things do n't really come from Google .
No , in my opinion , they do n't even come from museums .
Maybe I should n't say this .
Actually , they come from those artists .
And that 's been my humble experience with this .
I mean , I hope that in this digital medium , it makes justice for its artwork and that is represented properly online .
And the big question I 'm doing today is , `` You did this to repeat the experience of going into a museum ? ''
And the answer is not .
It is to supplement the experience .
And that 's all . Thank you .
Thank you .
Good afternoon everyone .
I have something to show you .
Think of it as a pixel , a flying pixel .
In our lab , we call it sensitive design .
I 'm going to tell you a little bit about this .
If you look at this picture -- I 'm an Italian origin , all the children in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom , but the reason I show you this is that there 's something very interesting about <unk> <unk> in the last two decades .
So some time ago , if you wanted to win a race of incarceration , I would take a budget and give it to a good pilot and a good car .
And if the car and the pilot were good enough , you won the career .
This is what , in engineering , we 've got control system in real time .
It 's essentially a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
Today what 's interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives .
Our cities , in the last few years , have been covered in networks and electronics .
You 're turning computers into the open .
And as such , they 're starting to respond differently , and they can be screened and <unk> .
<unk> cities is a big thing .
As a note aside , I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet 's cortex , but they represent 50 percent of the world 's population .
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions .
If we could do something with cities , it would be big .
Beyond cities , all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects .
This is from a <unk> <unk> exhibition for the weekends during the summer .
It 's called `` Talk to me . ''
Well , our objects , the environment , start telling us .
It 's kind of like if almost all the existing atoms were going into sensors and actuators .
And that 's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment .
In a sense , it 's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo ...
You know , when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses , he said that at the end , I took the hammer , and they threw it into Moses -- actually , you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and said , `` <unk> , <unk> ? '' ( Why do n't you talk ?
Well , today , for the first time , our environment begins to speak to us .
And I 'm going to show you just a few examples , <unk> the idea of taking the environment and push something out .
Let 's start with detection .
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab projects .
This was four and a half years ago in Italy .
It was a summer with fortune to 2006 .
It was the year where Italy won the World Cup .
Maybe some of you will play it in Italy and France , and at the end of the <unk> , they gave the <unk> .
And anyway , he won Italy .
Now , let 's look at what happened that day looking at activity happens in the network .
Here we see the city .
You see the Coliseum in the middle and the river <unk> .
It 's the morning before the game .
The timeline is at the top .
By the afternoon , there are people over here , and there 's called calls , moving .
It starts the party : silence .
<unk> from France . <unk> from Italy .
<unk> ; people do a quick call and go to the bathroom .
Second time . End of time .
First , the first time -- second .
<unk> , and at a moment , the <unk> .
They win Italy , yes !
That night everyone was to celebrate the center .
You see the big peak .
The next day they all went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister of the day .
And then everybody went down .
You see the picture of the place called <unk> , where , since Roman age , people will celebrate ; it 's a great party , you can see the peak at the end of the day .
This is just one example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we would n't have done just a few years ago .
Another quick example of detection : it 's not about people , but about things we use and we consume .
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects .
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac , how they assemble it .
But we know very little about where things are going .
So in this project , we developed some little tags to track the trash in their shift through the system .
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago , tagging what they were throwing -- different kinds of things , as you can see , things like that anyway , <unk> .
Then we put a little chip , a tag , and then we started <unk> .
These are the results that are from .
From Seattle .
After a week .
With this information we realized that there are lots of inefficiencies in the system .
We can do the same with much less energy .
These are data that they did n't have before .
There 's complicated things happening , and there 's a lot of unnecessary transport .
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that <unk> does n't go away , which is still somewhere on the planet .
That if the plastic bottle that we <unk> is still there .
If we show that to people , then we can promote some behavior change .
That was the reason for the project .
My colleague at MIT , <unk> <unk> , could tell us a lot more about detection , and many other things that we can do with that , but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning , which is push on the environment .
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk> .
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city , which came to us and told us that Spain and the South Europe has a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces , in architecture .
And the question was , how can technology , new technology , join that ?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT , in a workshop , was , imagine that they have a trunk and valves , <unk> tubes , <unk> open and closed .
It was created as a curtain of water , with pixels of water .
If the pixels can be written in them , show patterns , images , texts .
And we zoom in , the curtain will open up so that we can go , as you see in the image .
We presented this to the mayor <unk> .
She liked it a lot .
And then I <unk> a commission to design the building into the Expo .
We call it Digital Water <unk> .
The whole building is made of water .
There 's no windows or windows , but when you 're coming up , it opens so you can pass .
The roof is also covered with water .
And if there 's a little bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , you get down the ceiling .
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears , like in this case .
Those days there will always be somebody , in the winter , when they go down the roof , someone who was there and said , `` <unk> the building . ''
No , it 's not that they 've been demolished , but when all the architecture goes down , almost all the architecture disappears .
This is how it works .
You see the people who are going on inside .
And here I 'm myself trying to do n't get wet to test the sensors that open the water .
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
That night was actually even more fun .
All the children in <unk> came to the building , because the way to interact had changed a little bit .
It was n't a building that would open to leave you , but a building that was still making cuts and holes in water , and you had to jump to not getting wet .
( Noise of people ) And for us that was very interesting because as architects , engineers , designers , we always think of use that people will give our designs .
But then the reality is always unpredictable .
And that 's the beauty of doing things to interact , that people use .
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels , the pixels of water , and of projections over them .
And this is what led us to think about the next project I 'm going to show you .
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly .
Imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air , and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space .
This is the video .
Imagine a helicopter , like the one we saw before , which is moving with others in sync .
We could form this cloud .
It 's sort of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions .
Or normal , but in three dimensions , where what changes is light , not the pixel position .
You can play with a different kind .
Imagine the screen would appear in different scales and sizes , in different kinds of resolution .
And then all of that could be a helicopter cloud of 3D that you can zoom in , and see from very different angles .
This is the real <unk> <unk> , going down to form a V , like before .
When the light lights up , you see this . The same thing we saw before .
Imagine each one of them controlled by a person .
We can have each pixel with input that comes from people , the movement of people , etc. , etc .
I want to show you something for the first time .
We 've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers today , the star <unk> star , and the <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for the <unk> .
Here we can see <unk> dancing .
On the left you see the pixels , it captures in different resolutions .
It 's both digitization in real time as movement capture .
It can <unk> all the movement .
You can walk around the way .
And once we have the pixels , we can play with them , with color and movement , with gravity and rotation .
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk> .
I wanted to show you the last project we 're working on .
It 's something for the London Olympics .
It 's called the Cloud .
And the idea is , imagine again , that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our environment as an nursery <unk> as a barn farm , but with a cloud .
Imagine we could make everybody just a little bit for a pixel .
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that , in the last two decades , we went from the physical world to the digital world .
We 've digitized everything , like knowledge , and it 's accessible to the Internet .
Today , for the first time and Obama campaign , we can move from the digital world , the self-organizing power of the networks , the physical world .
In our case , this may be that we wanted to use it to design and make a symbol .
That would mean something built in a city .
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today : think about climate change or CO2 emissions , how will we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together , collectively .
The cloud is a cloud , again , made from the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud .
And those particles are water , whereas in our cloud , they are pixels .
It 's a physical structure in London , but covered with pixels .
You can move inside , having different experiences .
You can see from the bottom , it will serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more , and it can be used as a way of connection to the community .
So , it 's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up , like a new top of London .
You can get in there .
As if it was a new digital headlight at night , but most importantly , it will be a new experience for anyone to go to the top .
Thank you .
Would you like to be better than they are ?
Suppose I told you that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could improve memory -- for a more accurate , more accurate and faster .
Or maybe you 'd like to be in better ways , to be stronger , have more resistance .
Would you like to be more attractive and secure .
How about living more with good health ?
Or maybe it 's those people who always wanted to be more creative .
What else would you like ?
What would you like , if you could choose something ?
( Audience member : Creativity . ) Creativity .
How many people would choose creativity ?
Raise your hand . Let me see .
Very few . It 's probably due to the number of creative people .
That 's very good .
How many of you choose memory ?
A few more .
And the physical state ?
A little less .
How about longevity ?
Oh , most of them . That makes me feel very well as a doctor .
If you could have some of this , the world would be very different .
Is it just imagination ?
Or may it be possible ?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference , but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject .
The great 20th century geneticist , <unk> . <unk> , that also <unk> at the Church of <unk> <unk> , wrote an essay called `` Nothing in biology makes sense except for Evolution 's light . ''
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this , is it just about the past , or the future ?
refers to each other or to us ?
This is another look at the tree of life .
The human part of this branch , right at an extreme , is , of course , the most interested in us .
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
In the interval , there 's been maybe 20 different species of hominids .
Some have gone and back .
We 've been here about <unk> years .
It might seem that we 're very far away from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same .
Do you realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that 's used to treat diabetes ?
This is not like human insulin , but it 's the same protein , chemically indistinguishable , which comes out of the pancreas .
And talking about bacteria -- realize that we all take in the gut the more bacteria that we have in the rest of the body ?
Maybe 10 times more .
I mean , think -- when Antonio Damasio raises the <unk> -- think of bacteria ?
The gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
It 's warm , dark , wet , is very <unk> .
And we 're going to give them all the nutrients that you might want to do without effort in your part .
It 's really kind of a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush upstream .
But , for others , we 're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life .
They help digest the essential nutrients , and we protect certain diseases .
But what will the future hold ?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species ?
Or meant to become something different , perhaps better adapted to the environment ?
In this vast symphony of the universe , life on Earth is like a brief compass ; the animal kingdom , as one single and only <unk> , and human life , a little bit of grace .
That was us .
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk , so I hope you 've enjoyed it .
When I first reported to college , I had my first kind of biology .
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology .
I fell in love with the power of evolution , and I realized something fundamental : in most of the existence of life , in single-cell organisms , each cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters .
But when organisms show up multicellular organisms , things start to change .
It enters the sexual reproduction .
And something very important : the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
In fact , you might say that the inevitability of the body death comes in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction .
I have to confess , when I was a college student thought , well , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> death ; it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year he was going , each time was more doubt .
I came to understand the feelings of George Burns , which was still acting in Las Vegas in their 90s .
And one night , somebody hits their hotel door .
He opens the door .
In front of it , you find a magnificent little dancer of clothing .
He looks at it and says , `` I came looking for a sex soup .
`` All right , '' he says George , `` I chose the soup . ''
I realized , as a doctor , who was working on a different goal of the goal of evolution , not necessarily counterintuitive , just different .
I was trying to preserve the body .
I wanted to get healthy .
I wanted to get health to the disease .
I wanted them to live more and healthier .
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next generation , adapt and <unk> generation generation .
From an evolutionary standpoint , you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level that the orbiting level and then drop to the sea .
I think we all understand the feeling that Woody Allen when he said , `` I do n't want to achieve immortality through my work .
I want to achieve it not dying . ''
Evolution does n't necessarily pay longevity .
It does n't necessarily stop the biggest or stronger or faster or even the smartest .
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures in its environment .
That 's the only test of survival and success .
In the bottom of the ocean , the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would produce , if there were fish there , <unk> <unk> in the void , yet they 've managed to make it a <unk> environment .
So what does this mean , when we look at what 's happening in evolution , and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution , and in particular , if we look forward , to the next phase -- I would say there 's a lot of possibilities .
The first one is that they did n't get a stutter .
We 've reached a kind of balance .
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine , first of all , we 've known to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been discarded and cut from the population .
And secondly , as a species , we 've made our environment in order to fit ourselves as we adapt to it .
And by the way , they migrated out , <unk> , and we 're so happy that it 's no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to make it happen .
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional , natural type , imposed by the forces of nature .
And the argument here would be : that the gears of evolution they roll slowly , but they 're <unk> .
And in terms of isolation : when as a species of <unk> planets are going to be isolation , and the environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally .
But there is a third possibility , an attractive , intriguing , intriguing possibility .
I call it <unk> , the new evolution , which is not just natural -- but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions we will make .
Now , how could this happen ?
How could we do this ?
First , let 's think about the reality that many people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their offspring .
In some cultures , they are choosing more males than women .
It 's not necessarily good for society , but it 's what you choose at the individual and family level .
Think that if you could also be able to choose not only the sex of your offspring , but in your own body , make your own genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease .
What if we could make genetic changes for diabetes or Alzheimer 's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the stroke ?
Would n't you want to make those changes in their genes ?
If you look at the future , that kind of changes will be increasingly possible .
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 , sued 13 .
<unk> billion dollars .
The next year of finished , in 2004 , I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three months .
Today , you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at the close cost to $ 20,000 and on a week .
Not a lot of waste to make the human genome for $ 1,000 and to be more and more the scope of everyone .
Those changes come .
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just going to protect us , but they 're going to induce other viruses against other viruses .
Believe it or not there is an experimental trial in course with the <unk> vaccine cells in a tobacco facility .
Can you imagine something good about tobacco ?
That 's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible .
So imagine then only two little changes .
Can they change the cells of their bodies , but if they could change the cells of their offspring ?
What if they could change sperm and eggs , or change the <unk> <unk> , and give your children a better chance of a healthier life , to remove the diabetes , reduce the risk of cancer ?
Who does n't want healthier children ?
And then , that same analytical technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also allow you to adopt <unk> -- a better memory .
Why do n't you have the ingenuity of an Ken Jennings , especially if you were able to get the next generation of the machine Watson ?
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more distance ?
Why not live longer ?
This is going to be compelling .
And when we 're in conditions of transmitting this to the next generation , and we can take the attributes that we want to have become the evolution of before the <unk> .
We 're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to 1,000 years and maybe it was happening within the next 100 years .
These are choices that their grandchildren , or the grandchildren of their grandchildren , are going to have them .
Are we going to use these options on a better , more successful society , more <unk> ?
Or , are we going to make a selectively choice that we want for some of us but not for others ?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more broken or more robust and more maneuverable ?
This is the kind of question we 're going to have to face .
And the deepest of all : are we going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these choices wisely ?
For good or for bad , and before what you might think , these choices are going to depend on us .
Thank you .
Imagine a big explosion when you 're at 900 feet tall .
Imagine a plane full of smoke .
Imagine a motor by doing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . It sounds terrifying .
Well , I had a single seat that day . I was sitting in the <unk> .
It was the only one who could talk to flight assistants .
So he immediately looked at them , and they said , `` No problem . We probably hit some birds . ''
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane , and we were n't so far away .
You could see Manhattan .
Two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River .
Mostly that 's not the route .
Let 's run the motors .
Imagine being on an airplane and no noise .
And then three words said .
The three <unk> words I 've ever heard of .
He said , `` <unk> for the impact . ''
I did n't have to talk more with the flight assistant .
I was able to see it in his eyes .
It was terror . Life was finished .
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day .
I learned that everything changes in a moment .
We have this list of things to do before they die , these things that we want to do in life , and I thought about all the people I wanted to come and do n't , all the fences that I wanted to repair , all the experiences I 've wanted to have and I never had .
While I was thinking about that later , I came up a phrase , which is , `` I collect bad wines . ''
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there , I 'm going to open it .
I do n't want to <unk> anything anymore .
And that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as the bridge George Washington Bridge , which was not for a lot -- I thought about , wow , I really feel a great deal .
I 've lived a good life .
In my humanity and my mistakes , I 've tried to improve everything I did .
But in my humanity , I also turned to my ego .
And I 'm sorry about time that I 've wasted in things that really mattered with people who matter .
And I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
And then , like <unk> in that , I decided to remove the negative energy of my life .
It 's not perfect , but it 's much better .
Within two years I have n't had a fight with my wife .
It feels about wonders .
I do n't try to be right ; it will be happy .
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going down , `` 15 , 14 , 13 . ''
You see the water coming in .
I 'm saying , `` Please fly . ''
I do n't want this to break down in 20 pieces as you see on those documentaries .
And as I <unk> , I had the feeling of , `` Whoa , not fear .
It 's almost like we 've been <unk> for it all our life .
But it was very sad .
I did n't want to go ; I love my life .
And that sadness is spreading in a single thought , which is , I just wish one thing .
I wish I could see my children growing .
One month later , I was in my daughter 's performance -- first grade , not a lot of art talent -- yet , I scream , I cry , like a little .
And for me , that was the whole reason of being the world .
At that point , I understood , by connecting those two points , that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent .
For all , the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent .
A miracle gave me a miracle , not to die that day .
And they gave me another gift , which was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live differently .
You 're flying today , the challenge you can imagine that the same thing is going on on your airplane -- and please not be like this -- but imagine , how do you change ?
What would you do , you still expect to do because you think you 're going to live forever ?
How do you change your relationships and your negative energy on them ?
And most importantly , are the best parents who can ?
Thank you .
I 've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects .
But the most cool thing I worked on was for this guy .
The guy 's called <unk> .
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s .
He came to his house after running , and he said , `` Dad , I 'm sorry on your legs . ''
And that was the beginning of ALS .
Today , <unk> has complete paralysis .
You can only use your eyes .
Their job influenced me .
I have a design company and animation , so , obviously , graffiti is very intricate that we admire and respect the world of art .
So we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony , <unk> , and its cause .
So I went and met with his brother and father , and I said , `` Let 's give you this money .
What are they going to do with him ? ''
And his brother said , `` I just want to be able to talk to Tony again .
I just want to be able to communicate with it , and he 's able to communicate with me . ''
And I said , `` A second , is n't that you 've seen Stephen <unk> 's not that all people with paralysis can communicate with those devices ? ''
And he said , `` No , unless you 're somebody important and you have a very good insurance , you ca n't actually do it .
These devices are not affordable for people . ''
And I said , `` Well how do they communicate that ? ''
Did anybody see the movie `` <unk> and butterfly ? ''
They communicate that way -- they communicate with your finger .
I said , `` That 's archaic . How can it be ? ''
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check , and instead of that signed a check that I did n't have the lowest idea of how I was going to cover .
I commit to her brother and father there at that very moment , `` Well , this is the deal : Tony 's going to talk about , we 're going to build a machine , and we 're going to find a way to go back and do its art again .
Because it 's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside their inside ca n't be <unk> . ''
So I talked about a conference a couple months later .
I met these guys called <unk> Research Lab , which have a technology that lets you project a light on any surface , and then with a laser pointer , draws about it and register the negative space .
So they go around doing art facilities like this .
All the things that appear , they say , they 're part of a life cycle .
They first start with sexual organs , then with bad words , then with the Bush attacks , and at the end , people start doing art .
But there was always a life cycle in his presentations .
And so he started the journey .
And about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization , and a lot of organization and a lot of the way we had done a couple of things .
One , we touch the doors of insurance companies , and we got a machine that could <unk> could communicate ; a machine like Stephen Hawking 's .
Which was great .
And seriously , it 's the most fun thing ; I call him <unk> because when I 'm talking to the guy , you get an email from him , and you say , `` I do n't deserve it . This guy 's fantastic . ''
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from the entire world of all the world in the corner of the <unk> to our house .
My wife , the kids and I , we moved to the garage behind the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took over the house .
Many of our friends thought we 'd done something totally stupid , and that when they would have taken off the walls of the walls and in place there would be graffiti .
But for two weeks , we went to the sea walk , my son was part , my dog was part , and we created this .
It 's called <unk> , and you can see the description .
They 're a pair of <unk> <unk> that we buy on the shipping ride of <unk> Beach , and some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio Shack .
We take a <unk> camera , we cut it open , we set up on a LED light , and there 's a device that is free -- and it 's built oneself ; we published the code <unk> software down for free .
And we created a device that has no limitation at all .
There 's no insurance company to say `` no . ''
There are no hospital I can say `` no . ''
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes .
Thank you .
Thank you very much for you . That was awesome .
So at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
I love this picture because this is the other room 's room , and that 's his room .
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening .
And after more than a year of planning , two weeks of programming , intense sessions , from all night , Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years .
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life , and he 's looking through the support system of his life .
We ran the bed so I could see .
And we put a projector on a wall of the hospital park outside the hospital .
And he turned back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what feeling was in the parking lot .
The funny thing was that we had to <unk> in the parking lot so that we feel like we were <unk> with graffiti as well .
At the end of this , he sent us an email , and this was what we said , `` This was the first time I was in seven years old .
I felt like I had been under the water , and somebody finally came to <unk> and pull me out of the way that I could breathe . ''
Is n't that wonderful ?
In a way , it 's our cry of war .
That 's what keeps us in motion , developing .
And we have a long way to go with this .
It 's a cool device , but it 's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk> .
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more .
So we 're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and faster .
Since then we 've had all kinds of recognition .
We 've won a lot of awards .
Remember , it 's free ; none of us are doing money with this .
Everything comes out of our own pockets .
The prizes were the guy , `` Oh , this is fantastic . ''
Armstrong tweeted something about us and then December Time magazine acknowledged us as one of the top 50 inventions in 2010 , and it was really cool .
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up close to the <unk> is that in April of this year at the <unk> of Los Angeles , there 's going to be an exhibition called `` Art in <unk> . ''
And `` Art in <unk> '' is going to have the best <unk> of urban urban art , <unk> <unk> , <unk> all of them going to be there .
<unk> is going to be on the show , which is pretty impressive .
So , basically this is my idea : if you see something that 's not possible , do it possible .
None of what 's in this room was possible -- the scenario , the microphone , the microphone , nothing was possible at some point .
Do anything in this room .
I 'm not a programmer , I never did anything with eye recognition technology ; I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen .
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel to do . If not now , when ? And if I 'm not me , who ?
Thank you guys .
I 've spent the last few years <unk> in most often very difficult situations and at the same time as a dangerous thing .
I went to prison -- hard .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
It 's in conflict , difficult and dangerous .
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun in the beginning , something difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
In fact , in great part of my career I 've been <unk> in horrible ways with the only goal of dealing with , and to look at social issues in ways that will be attractive , interesting , and hopefully analyze it in a way that looks cool and accessible to the audience .
So when I knew that I was coming here to make a TEDTalk about the world of the brands and patronage , I wanted to do something a little bit different .
So some of you may have heard it , or not , a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> warning .
I sent a few messages on Facebook , some on Twitter , I volunteered for the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011 .
What was the next thing : `` <unk> <unk> presents me : my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and depending on the face , especially if I put it in ridicule for you or your company to do it .
But said , this is a very good media opportunity . ''
You know how many people look at these TEDTalks ?
A lot of them .
It 's a title of progress , by the way .
So even with that <unk> knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name .
If you had asked me a year ago , I would n't have been able to tell them for sure .
But in the new film I 'm working on , we tested the world of marketing , of advertising .
And as I said earlier , I 've been in horrible situations over the last few years , but nothing could be done , nothing could be done , for something as difficult or as dangerous as I get into the rooms with these guys .
You see , I had this idea for a movie .
Morgan <unk> : I want to make a film that treating the <unk> of products , marketing and advertising , and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> , marketing and advertising .
The film is going to call `` The largest movie you ever sold . ''
What happens in `` The largest movie you ever sold '' is that all the top down at the bottom end , has a brand imagery , all the time -- from the <unk> that appears before the title , the brand X mark .
Now this brand , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Center .
These people were <unk> in the film in perpetuity .
And so the film explores all this idea . ( Michael <unk> : It 's redundant . '' That 's what ?
I 'm a date . ( MK : I just say it . It was more by emphasis .
It was `` In perpetuity . It 's forever . ''
But we 're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title , but we 're going to make sure we 're going to make sure all the categories that we can in the film .
Maybe we sell a shoe , and it becomes the most great shoe that you use .
The greatest car that you 've driven in `` The largest movie you 've ever sold , '' the best drink you 've ever heard , <unk> from `` The largest movie you ever sold . ''
<unk> <unk> : The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life , making them <unk> the film ? ( MS : To <unk> the film ) MS : And we actually show the whole process of how it works .
The whole thing is transparency .
You 're going to see all the process in this movie .
That 's the whole idea , all the film , from beginning to end .
And I would love to help make it happen .
Robert Friedman : You know , it 's funny because it 's funny because it 's the first time I hear that ; it 's the ultimate respect for the audience .
<unk> : However , I do n't know how supportive is going to be people .
<unk> : You 've got a perspective -- I do n't know if `` angle '' is very <unk> , but you know how it 's going to resonate ? ( MS : No idea . David <unk> : How much money does it take to do this ?
MS : A million and a half . ( <unk> : All right . ) John Kamen : I think it 's going to be hard the meeting with them , but it certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple big brands .
<unk> : Who knows , maybe for the moment to go out the movie , we can see as a lot of joyful idiots .
MS : What do you think it 's going to be the answer ?
Stuart <unk> : Most of the answers are `` no . ''
MS : But will it be difficult for selling , by film or being me ?
JK : Both things .
MS : ... means you 're not very optimistic .
So , they help me ? I need help .
MK : I can help .
MS : All right . ( MK : Good . ) Awesome .
MK : We have to think about which brands .
MS : Yeah . ( MK : That 's the challenge . ) When you look at the people you have to treat ...
MK : We have some places where to go . ( MS : Okay . ) <unk> the camera .
MS : I thought , `` shuts off the camera . '' meant we have a conversation outside .
<unk> the camera means , `` We do n't want to know anything about your movie . ''
MS : And that was , one by one , all these companies all of a sudden disappeared .
None wanted to have anything to do with this movie .
I was shocked .
They did n't want to know anything about this project .
And he was very impressed , and I thought that the concept of advertising , it was to introduce the product to as many people as possible , to make so many people see it as possible .
Especially in the world today , this intersection of new media and old media and the middle media scenario , is n't the idea to tell you with that new vehicle worthy of attention , which is going to take the message to the masses ?
No , that was what I thought .
But the problem was , you see , that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that mistake was this .
Actually , there was no mistake .
There was no mistake at all .
This would have been fine .
But the problem was what this image represents .
See , when you look for <unk> images on Google , this is one of the first images that appear .
I like your way to roll , Sergey Brin . No .
This was the problem : the transparency -- free of simulation or deception , and easily detected or seen , which is characterized by the visibility or access of information , especially in business practices -- the last line perhaps the biggest problem .
You see , we heard a lot about transparency in these days .
Our politicians named the name , the president knows , even by CEOs .
But suddenly when it comes to making it , something changes suddenly .
But why ? Well , transparency is afraid -- like that weird bear that still continues .
It 's unpredictable -- like this strange rural path .
And it 's also very risky .
What else is it a risky ?
<unk> a whole bowl of Cool Carpet .
That 's pretty risky .
When I started talking to the companies and tell them , we wanted to tell the story , and they said , `` No , we want you to tell <unk> . ''
We want you to tell a story , but let 's tell you . ''
See , when I was a kid , and my father came up with me in some lie -- and there he is , looking at me as he used to say , `` Son , there 's three sides in every story .
There 's your story , it 's my story , and it 's the real story . ''
As you can see , in this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
But with just one company , a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own , I would have to take the intermediary and go to companies myself with all my team .
So what I started to figure out all of a sudden -- and I started to show myself , is that when you start talking to companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
MS : I have friends who make big movies , huge , giant movies , and others that make small movies , independent , like mine .
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies , giants , they say the reason their movies have so successful is because of the associated brands that they have .
And then my friends doing independent movies say , `` Well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant Hollywood movies . ''
And the film is called `` The largest movie you ever sold . ''
How are we going to see specifically , in the film ?
Every time I 'm going to go out , every time I open my <unk> , you 'll see your deodorant .
At any time during an interview with someone , I can say , `` Are you cool for this interview ?
Are you ready ? You see you a little bit nervous .
I want to help you get to you .
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the interview . ''
And there I would offer one of these fabulous smells .
And so much `` <unk> <unk> '' like `` Paradise of Paradise . ''
We 're going to have a lot of man for women -- it 's solid , to <unk> , in bar , like it .
That 's the general look .
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at them .
Karen Frank : We are a small brand .
Similar to the kind of little movies that you actually do ; we 're rather a rival brand .
So we do n't have the budget of other brands .
So doing things like that , you know , remind people , people are the reason that we 're interested in .
MS : What words would you use to describe to the sickness ?
It 's in white .
KF : That 's a big question .
Volunteer : upper technology .
MS : Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk> .
Man : We 're talking about something bold , fresh .
I think `` cool '' is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus `` combat the smell and the sweat . ''
It keeps you cool .
How do you keep you fresh , more time ?
Things like those that highlight benefits .
MS : And that 's a <unk> company .
What about me ? What about a common guy ?
I need to talk to the man on the street , to people like me , to the common <unk> .
They have to talk to me about my brand .
MS : How do you define your brand ?
Man : Mmm my brand ?
I do n't know .
I like good clothes .
Woman : revive the '80s , <unk> <unk> ' unless it 's a laundry day .
MS : Okay , what is the <unk> brand ?
<unk> : Something unique . ( MS : I guess the kind of gender , the style I have would be like a dark <unk> .
I like a lot of dark colors , lots of gray , things like that .
It 's usually wearing accessories as sunlight , or I like the crystals and similar .
Woman : If Dan was a brand classic <unk> , Mercedes Benz .
Man 2 : The mark that I am , I would call it a fluke .
Woman 2 : In part of hippie , it 's partly <unk> , in part <unk> Brooklyn , I do n't know .
Man 3 : I 'm the kind of pets .
They 're putting pets toys for pets in the country and in the world .
So I guess that 's my brand .
In my small sector , that 's my brand .
Man 4 : My brand 4 : My brand is FedEx , because they deliver the stock .
Man 5 : The <unk> <unk> failed .
Is that something ?
<unk> : I 'm a lawyer .
Tom : I 'm Tom .
MS : Well , not all of us can be made of Tom , but I 'm often <unk> at the intersection of dark <unk> , ' and <unk> casual .
I realized I needed an expert .
I needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who could help me understand what they call `` <unk> personality . ''
And I found a company called Olson in Pittsburgh .
They helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , employee to discover that brand personality .
If they were able to do it , they could surely do it for me .
<unk> : <unk> photos , right ?
MS : Yeah . The first picture is a familiar picture .
A : Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be .
MS : These people shape my way to see the world .
A : Tell me about that world .
MS : That world ? I think your world is the world that you live in -- your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work you do .
All those things come from and start in a place and in my case where they start and start in my family , West Virginia .
A : What 's the next one you want to talk about ?
MS : The next one is , `` This was the best day of my life . ''
A : How does this relate to your thoughts , feelings and your way to be ?
MS : It 's like who I wanted to be .
I like different things .
I like weird things . I like weird things .
A : Tell me about why , why do we use that ?
What 's the machete ? What 's the <unk> of the <unk> you are now ?
Why is it important to reset ? What is the red ?
Tell me a little bit about that .
A little more of you , that 's not who you are .
What other <unk> have you had ?
You do n't have to be frightened . What kind of rollercoaster are you ?
MS : <unk> ! ( A ! ) No , thank you .
A : Thank you for your patience . ( MS : Great work ) A : Yeah . ( MS : Thank you so much . ) All right .
MS : Yeah , I do n't know what 's going to come out of this .
There was a lot of madness to all of this .
<unk> <unk> : The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides , but complementary , in your brand personality -- the Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand .
They get very well together .
And I think there 's almost a paradox of it .
And I think some companies will only be embedded in one of their strengths or on the other instead of focusing on both .
A lot of companies tend to believe -- and it 's the wild nature to avoid the things that are not safe ; they avoid fear , those elements , and you 're actually <unk> and you make that good for you , and it 's nice to see that .
What other brands are that ?
The first here is classic , Apple .
And you can also see here with Target , Wii , Mini , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Now there are <unk> marks and brands , those things that have gone and come , but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful .
MS : A <unk> mark . What 's your brand brand ?
If someone asks you to <unk> your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be ?
Are you a upward attribute ? Are you somebody who makes blood flow ?
Or are you rather a downward attribute ?
A little bit more cool , reserved , conservative ?
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like Port-au-Prince , contemporary , adventurous , <unk> or bold as <unk> , <unk> , profane , profane , dominant , magic or mystic , like <unk> .
Or are you rather than a <unk> attribute ?
You 're aware , sophisticated as a <unk> ?
You 're now , traditional , traditional , provider , provider , leave you with Oprah ?
Are you reliable , stable , familiar , reliable , <unk> , wiser , wise or wise , like the Dalai Lama or <unk> ?
In the course of this film , we had over 500 companies and bottom-up and descending , they said `` no , '' they did n't want to be part of this project .
They did n't want to have anything to do with this film , mainly because they would n't have control , they would n't have control over the end product .
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> , and we came to tell the story on this movie of how you use the MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing as cinema .
We went to San Paulo where they 've banned advertising in the air .
In the entire city for the last five years , there 's no fences , no posters , there 's no <unk> , nothing .
And we went to school districts where companies are getting the way in schools with liquidity problems in the U.S .
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I 've had the greatest response or the ones I 've been more successful is the ones I 've interacted with things directly .
And that 's what these brands did .
<unk> the <unk> , they took off their agencies , and they said maybe these agencies do n't have my best interest in mind .
I 'm going to try directly with the artist .
I 'm going to work with him to create something different , something that 's going to make people think , to challenge the way we look at the world .
And how did they go ? Did they succeed ?
Well , since the movie was released at the Sundance , let 's take a look .
According to the movie , the movie was released in January , and since then -- and this is not <unk> , we 've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film .
This covers just a two and a half weeks .
That 's just online -- no press , no TV .
The film is still not <unk> .
It 's not online . It 's not in <unk> .
It 's not even presented in other countries yet .
Ultimately , this film has begun to win momentum .
And it 's not bad because almost all the agencies that we 're talking about is <unk> to their clients .
I 've always believed that if you risk , if you take risks , that in those risks there are opportunities .
I think when you take people out of that , it 's pushing it to failure .
I think that when you train their employees in loss of risk , they 're preparing their entire company to lack rewards .
I feel that what 's going to happen to make progress is that we need to encourage people to encourage the risk .
We have to encourage people to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford .
Ultimately , I think we need to give it to fear .
We have to put that bear in a cage .
<unk> fear . <unk> the risk .
From <unk> at once , we have to embrace the risk .
And ultimately , we have to harbor transparency .
More than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way .
And said , with honesty and transparency , all of my talk , `` <unk> the Transparency '' has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> the rights of the name on <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world .
<unk> presents the Transparency .
Thank you very much .
June Cohen : So Morgan , in the name of transparency , that exactly happened with those $ <unk> ?
MS : It 's a remarkable question .
In my pocket , I have a check for the name of the TED matrix , the Sapling Foundation , a check for $ <unk> to be applied to my <unk> for TED year .
The idea behind the <unk> computer worm is really very simple .
We do n't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb .
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time .
If we manage to compromise these systems that control speeds and valves , we can have lots of problems with the centrifuge .
The gray boxes do n't use Windows software ; they 're a completely different technology .
But if we get a cash cash virus in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box , then we 're ready .
This is the plan behind Stuxnet .
We started with a Windows <unk> .
The <unk> go to the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the Iranian program is <unk> ; mission accomplished .
Is it easy , huh ?
I want to tell you how we discovered this .
When we started investigating about Stuxnet six months ago , the purpose was completely unknown .
The only thing that you knew is that it 's very , very complex in the Windows part : the <unk> wore multiple vulnerabilities <unk> .
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these control systems .
And that struck us , and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Stuxnet , and we saw what was going on with this .
So they went very strange things .
Stuxnet behaved like a laboratory rat that did n't like our cheese : it smelled , but he did n't want to eat .
It did n't make sense for me .
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese , I realized , and I thought , `` This is a targeted attack .
It 's completely addressed . ''
The <unk> is looking for actively in the gray box if it finds a specific setup , and even if the program that 's trying to infect is effectively working on that place .
If no , Stuxnet did nothing .
So that I called my attention , and we started working in this almost 24 hours a day , because I thought , `` We do n't know what the goal is . ''
It could be , say , for example , a U.S. energy plant , or a chemical plant in Germany .
Better than the goal is soon .
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack code , and we discovered that it was structured in two digital bombs : a small and big one .
We also saw that they were armed very professionally by people who obviously had all the internal information .
We <unk> all the points for us to attack .
You probably even know how much the operator fits .
So you know everything .
And if you 've heard that <unk> 's <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the burden is very complex .
It 's very above all we 've seen before .
Here 's a sample of this code of attack .
We 're talking about about 15 lines of code .
It looks pretty much like old language <unk> .
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code .
What we were looking for at the beginning were calls the functions because we know what they do .
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures , and we tried to <unk> it with the real world , with potential goals of the real world .
We need the theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk> .
To get to theories about goals , we remember that it 's definitely a violent <unk> , it must be a valuable white , and it 's probably located in Iran , because it 's where most infections have been <unk> .
There are not several thousand targets in that area .
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
So I told my assistant , `` <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our clients . ''
I called them , and I consulted them in an effort to marry their experience with what we found in code and data .
And it worked pretty well .
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of rotor .
The rotor is that cell part in the centrifuge , that black object you see .
If you run the speed of this rotor there , you can certainly <unk> and even make the centrifuge explode .
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers , so they could n't solve this quickly .
We 're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and its structures .
So , for example , the number of <unk> stands up in that code , you ca n't afford it .
So I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they 're <unk> in <unk> , and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk> .
That made sense , there was a coincidence .
And it got better even .
These <unk> in Iran are split in 15 parts called stages .
And guess what we find in the code of attack ?
It 's an almost identical structure .
So again , that was a good coincidence .
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands of .
So no misunderstanding there was n't .
The results have been collected from several weeks of hard work .
It 's routinely <unk> on dead ends , and we had to start .
Yet , we found that these two digital warheads were going to just one and same goal , but from different angles .
The small <unk> is taking a waterfall , and turning the roadable and <unk> , and the big <unk> communicates with six waterfalls and manipulating valves .
In sum , we 're very confident that we have determined what the recipient is .
It 's <unk> , and it 's just <unk> .
We should n't worry about other goals to be <unk> by Stuxnet .
So I show you some very interesting things that we saw , really struck me .
There 's the gray box , and the top , you see the <unk> .
What this is doing is <unk> the input values of the sensors for example , of the pressure sensors and provides the vibration sensors and provides legitimate code , which is still running during the attack , with false input data .
And believe it or not , these fake input data is <unk> by Stuxnet .
It 's like in Hollywood movies where , during theft , the security chamber feeds on <unk> video .
Is that cool ?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control .
It 's really much more dangerous and aggressive .
The idea is <unk> a digital security system .
We need digital security systems where a human operator could n't perform fast .
For example , in an energy plant , when the big steam turbine is happening , you have to open up <unk> valves for a millisecond .
Obviously , this ca n't do a human operator .
That 's where we need digital security systems .
And when they 're committed , then they can get bad things .
The plant can exploit .
And the <unk> and the security system will notice you .
That scares you .
But it can be worse .
What I 'm going to say is very important .
Think of this . This attack is generic .
It has nothing to do , specifically , with <unk> , with uranium <unk> .
It could also work as well , for example , in a power plant , or in a automotive factory .
It 's generic .
And you do n't have -- as attacker -- that disseminate this burden of a USB key , as we saw in the case of Stuxnet .
You could also use conventional technology of worm <unk> .
Let 's get more as possible .
And if you made that , what you 're doing is with a mass of mass destruction .
That 's the consequence we need to face .
Unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East .
It 's in the United States and Japan .
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals .
We need to face the consequences , and the better that we start to prepare now .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I have a question .
Ralph , has become public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this .
What 's your opinion ?
Ralph <unk> : Okay , you really want to hear this ?
Yeah . Okay .
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved , but the engine is not Israel .
The engine behind this is cyber superpower .
There is one , and that 's the United States alone , fortunately , fortunately .
Because otherwise , our problems would be even bigger .
CA : Thank you for <unk> . Thank you , Ralph .
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you <unk> skills , or another that makes users of <unk> chairs up and go back and go back .
In `` <unk> <unk> '' we call these robots , exoskeletons .
They 're not different than something that you put in the morning , gives you a huge force , which also increases its speed , and it helps , for example , to handle the balance .
It 's actually the real integration of man and the machine .
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect it into the universe and with other entities .
This is not an unreal idea .
To show you now what we 're working on , we started talking about the American soldier that , on average , should take on their back , a <unk> load , and you 're trying to bring it even more equipment .
Obviously , this leads to some major complications -- injuries in the back , 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage .
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help to handle the issue .
So let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or the <unk> <unk> Human Human Human
Soldier : With the <unk> exoskeleton , I can carry about 90 pounds per variable for many hours .
Their flexible design , it allows you to <unk> and execute the movements with a great agility .
I mean what I want to do , or where I want to go , and then my strength goes up and my resistance .
<unk> <unk> : We 're ready , with our industrial partner , to produce this device , this new exoskeleton , this year .
So it 's a reality .
So let 's go back to the users of <unk> chairs , what I feel really passionate about .
It 's 68 million people about the <unk> , all over the world .
Like one percent of the total population .
And this is a really conservative calculation .
We talk about something that happens very often , very young people , with damage to the column that when they start their life -- to the 20 , 30 or 40 years -- they collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice .
We 're also talking about the population that gets older you quickly .
Their only choice , many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- it 's the wheelchair .
And this has been this way for the last 500 years , since their successful emergence , as I should recognize .
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility .
Let me introduce you to the <unk> , which is using Amanda <unk> , who had a lesion on the spinal cord , and as a result , he could n't walk back for 19 years , so far .
Amanda <unk> : Thank you .
EB : Amanda is using our <unk> , that I mentioned .
It has some sensors .
It 's completely <unk> on crutches , which send signals to the computer on board , here on the back .
There are also a few batteries that give you energy to the engines , and on the knees , and they make it forward with this kind of smooth and very natural .
AB : I was 24 years old at the top of my life when I was a stranger jump in the air , skiing down on the bottom , was paralyzed .
In a fraction of a second , I lost all sensation and all the <unk> of the pelvis down .
Soon after , a doctor walked into my room in the hospital , and he said , `` Amanda , you 're never coming to walk . ''
That happened 19 years ago .
So I stole the last hint of hope for me .
<unk> technology since then , it 's allowed me to learn to <unk> it down in <unk> , climbing rocks and even riding on a bicycle .
But they have n't invented anything that lets me walk , so far .
Thank you .
EB : As you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit and talk to you .
It 's in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers , but to Amanda , and all the <unk> users , all of us .
AB : Thank you .
I 've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival .
It 's a place where women have the baton , they practice sex to say hello , and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious .
And no , it 's not the <unk> ' festival or San Francisco .
Ladies and gentlemen , meet the cousins .
This is the global bonobos world in Congo forests .
The bonobos are , along with the chimps , their closest living relatives .
That means that we all share a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , that lived about six million years ago .
Now the chimps are known for their aggression .
But unfortunately , we 've done too much emphasis on this thing in our narratives of human evolution .
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large , terrifying types , the Bonobo society is in charge of females .
These guys have created something special , because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has n't yet observed .
But unfortunately , the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes .
They live in the depths of the <unk> jungle , and it 's been very difficult to study them .
Congo is a paradox of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the <unk> itself -- the stage of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War .
No wonder that this destruction is also putting up the survival of the Bonobo .
The hunting trade and deforestation do n't make you fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly , we 're not sure that .
However , on this land of violence and chaos , you can hear the laughter hidden by the trees .
Who are these cousins ?
We know them as the apes , `` make love , not war , '' because they have frequent sex , <unk> and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems .
I 'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the Bonobo 's life is more than <unk> <unk> .
The bonobos , as humans , they love to play all their life .
Play is not just a kid 's game .
For us , the game is fundamental to establish ties and foster tolerance .
With him , we learn to trust , and we learn the rules of the game .
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
And when you look at the Bonobo game , you see the very evolutionary roots themselves , the dance and the human ritual .
The game is the glue that unites us .
I do n't know how you play , but I want to show you a couple unique videos that just took out of the wild .
First , it 's a <unk> <unk> game -- and I 'm not talking about soccer .
Here 's a female and a young male in the middle of a chase .
Look what she 's doing .
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , `` It 's got it from the balls . ''
I just think in this case he loves it , right ?
Yeah .
So sexual play is commonplace as much as in humans like humans .
And this video really is interesting , because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and raise trust -- and at the same time it 's more fun .
But the game is <unk> .
The game is <unk> , you can take a lot of ways , some of which are more <unk> , imaginative , curious -- maybe the place where the awe will be .
And I want you to see -- this is <unk> , a young female , who 's playing with <unk> water .
I think that , like she , sometimes we play alone , and explore the limits of our inner and outside worlds .
And it 's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity .
These are just tiny samples of the understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present .
But they also have a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to a more and harder world more and more creativity .
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities .
In other words , play is our <unk> .
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play .
But will we learn how to play it ?
The game is not <unk> .
The game is essential .
For bonobos and human beings alike , life is not just cruel and ruthless .
When it looks at the least appropriate play , it may be the most urgent time .
So , primates , let 's take this gift of evolution and play together while I <unk> creativity , friendship and wonder .
Thank you .
In New York I 'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin Hood .
When I 'm not fighting poverty , <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a body of volunteers .
And in our city , where volunteers are , to a highly skilled staff , have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunteer on the site , so I had a pretty high probability of going .
But still there was a race up against the other volunteers to get the captain to the captain and find out what our homework was .
When I found the captain , I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life .
We were at night , and she was standing outside in the rain , under an umbrella , in the pajamas , while his house was on fire .
The other volunteer I had just arrived before I was , <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain , and he asked him to go inside and she would save the dog 's owner .
The dog ! I was <unk> <unk> !
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that , during the rest of his life , I would have to tell people that I entered a burning building to save a live self just because I won for five seconds .
Well , I was the next .
The captain made me a <unk> .
He said , `` Bezos , I need to get home .
I need to go up , <unk> the fire , and he brings this woman a pair of shoes . ''
I swear .
It was n't exactly what I expected , but I went down the stairs , at the end of the hall , went to the fire department , which is that that height or less had finished off the fire , and I went into the main room looking for a pair of shoes .
I know what you 're thinking , but I 'm not a hero .
I took my payload back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door .
We got out of the house to the house owner for the house owner , as I was waiting , his treasure got a lot more attention than me .
A few weeks later , the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save her house .
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that someone had reached a pair of shoes .
Both in my calling in Robin Hood , as in my calling as a fireman , I 'm witness to acts of generosity and kindness on monumental scale , but also of grace and courage at the individual level .
And you know what I 've learned ?
Everything has its importance .
So , when I look at this room to people who have achieved , or they 're going to get really remarkable levels of success , I 'd like to remind you of this : Do n't wait .
Do n't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody 's life .
If you have something to give , let 's get it now .
<unk> food in a dining room , <unk> a neighborhood park .
They 're mentors .
Not every day we 're going to have the opportunity to save someone 's life , but every day we 're going to be able to influence somebody 's life .
So they trained to play ; they get the shoes .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark , it comes back .
Mark Bezos : Thank you .
This may seem strange , but I 'm a big fan of the concrete block .
The first concrete blocks were built in 1868 with a very simple idea : the cement modules of a fixed measure that fit together .
Very quickly , these became the most used construction unit in the world .
They 've allowed us to build bigger things than we , like buildings or bridges , a brick at the same time .
Essentially , these blocks have become the pillars of our time .
Almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , in 1947 we came up with this .
It 's called the Machine assembly .
And in a few years , the brick bricks came to every home .
It 's estimated that they 've been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per single person on the planet .
You do n't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or houses .
It made it accessible .
It was simply adopted the concrete block , the favorite one in the world , and became a fundamental piece of our imagination .
Meanwhile , exactly that same year , in the Bell Labs , the next revolution was about to <unk> : the new building block .
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of bricks that would take us out of a <unk> bricks and a half a world where everything was interactive .
Like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex , a brick at the same time .
But there 's a main difference : The transistor was just for experts .
I do n't personally accept it , that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts , so I decided to change it .
Eight years ago , when I was at the Media Lab , I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers into the hands of artists and designers .
A few years ago , I started developing <unk> .
I 'm going to show you how they work .
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function .
They 're <unk> to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
And the best of all is that they put together through magnets .
So you ca n't put it wrong .
The bricks have a color code .
The green is the exit , the blue is the current , the pink is the input , and the orange one is the wire .
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green one and very quickly , you can start making bigger circuitry .
There 's blue with green one , they produce light .
We can put a button in the middle , and then we have a regulator .
If we change the button by a pulse module , which is here , and now we have a turn on it .
We added this timbre to create more impact , and we have a noise machine .
I 'm going to stop this .
So beyond the simple game , they 're actually very powerful .
Instead of having to program , connecting and goats , <unk> allows us to program using a very simple intuitive gestures .
To make faster and slower blink , just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower .
The idea behind <unk> is that it 's a growing collection .
We want all the interactions in the world , <unk> bricks ready to use .
Enlightenment , sounds , solar panels , motors ; everything should be accessible .
We 've given the kids <unk> to play with them .
And it 's been an amazing experience .
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that do n't learn in schools .
For example , how a night light works , or why the elevator door is held open , or how an iPod responds to touch .
We 've also taken <unk> to design schools .
So , for example , designers without expertise in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material .
Here you can see , with paper bottles and felt , we have <unk> creating ...
( metallic sound ) A few weeks ago , we brought <unk> to the Rhode Island School of Design , which has no experience in engineering , just in cardboard , wood and paper , and we said , `` Do something .
Here 's an example of a project that has done , a <unk> cannon .
But wait , here 's my favorite project .
It 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For these <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics became another material .
And we want this material to be within reach of all .
So , <unk> has open source .
You can visit the website , download all the files of design files and <unk> .
We want to encourage a world of creators , inventors and collaborators because this world we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
So go ahead and invent .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries .
I work in the solar technology industry .
And my little company is trying to get involved in the environment .
<unk> collaboration .
This is a little video of what we do .
Hmm . Wait a moment .
You might take a little bit to charge .
We can -- we can have better leave the video on one side .
No .
This is not ...
All right .
The solar technology is ...
Oh , do you really term me ?
All right . Thank you very much .
A couple of years ago , I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in a environment that represents almost everything they hate ; we asked them to work in the government .
The initiative was called <unk> for America , and it would be like a <unk> of Peace .
We had some members every year and we put them to work with them .
Instead of sending them into the Third World , we send them to the wild world .
They made great applications ; they worked with the city employees .
Its task is to show the possibilities of today 's technology .
So think of it .
It 's a hydrant in Boston .
Here appears as if I would find a quote , but what you really do is that someone to clean it up when you 're caught up in the snow , because you know it 's not very good by turning fires when it 's covered by a meter of snow .
How did he ask for help in this particular way ?
Last year in Boston , we had a team of members of <unk> for America .
They were there in February and at the time it 's a lot of time last year .
They realized the city never wiped out the city hydrants .
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else : that citizens cleaned up with shovels right in front of them .
So he did a good programmer , developed an app .
It 's a nice application where you can take a fire hydrant .
You embrace <unk> when it snows .
When you do that , you put a name in this case , in this case he put him in .
If you do n't , somebody can <unk> them .
I mean , it has a playful component .
It 's a modest application .
Maybe it 's the smallest of the 21 applications that happened last year .
But it does something that no other technology of the government does .
And it spreads viral .
A responsible for <unk> systems in Honolulu in looking at this app realized it could use it , not for snow , but for citizens to embrace the tsunami <unk> .
It 's very important that these <unk> are working , but people steal the batteries .
So it asks citizens to control them .
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> blindfolded .
And Chicago 's just dumped it to get the people in the end to clean sidewalks when it snows .
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it .
And this has been spread without friction , naturally and natural .
If you know a little government technology , you know this does n't normally happen .
The acquisition of software generally takes a couple of years .
Last year in Boston , we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months .
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children .
Then they told us that they 've done it by the normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and two million dollars .
And that 's nothing .
Now there 's a project in criminal justice , which is to the moment two billion dollars and it does n't work .
And there are projects like this at every level of government .
So an app that shows up in a couple of days and <unk> in a viral form is a kind of shooting at the institution of government .
It suggests the better government to work , not like in private companies , as many people think it should be .
Nor as a technological company , but rather like the Internet itself .
That is , no restrictions , in the way open and generative .
And that 's important .
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way we tackle the question of the government that has the new generation -- not as a problem of an institution , but as a collective action problem .
And that 's very good because it turns out we 're very good for the collective action with digital technology .
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together effectively .
And it 's not just <unk> for America , but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities .
They have n't given up with the government .
They feel a great frustration to that , but they do n't complain , they manage .
And these people know something that we 've lost from sight .
And that is that if you leave the feelings about politics , the line in the <unk> , the <unk> -- and all of those other things that we 're putting into , the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> : `` What we do together , because we ca n't . ''
Now , a lot of people have abandoned government .
If you are one of those people , I would ask you to <unk> it , because things are changing .
Politics does n't change ; the government does .
And since the last instance , ultimately , from us -- remember that from `` us , the people , '' how to think about it how to produce change .
I did n't know a lot of government when I started with this .
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to take a piece of charges .
Well , after two years I 've come to the conclusion that the government is , especially , about <unk> .
This is the center of services and information care .
It 's the place that serves the calls if you make your mark on the U.S .
Scott <unk> this call .
He said `` <unk> '' on the official knowledge .
I found nothing . It started with animal control .
And finally he said , `` Hey , you can open your house door , put the music loud and see if you go ? ''
And it worked . So for Scott .
But that was n't the end of the <unk> .
Boston does n't have a call center .
It has an app , web and mobile , called <unk> <unk> .
You do n't have that app .
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New <unk> University in Boston .
One day , this really happened , comes this request : `` <unk> in my garbage bucket . I do n't know if it 's dead .
How do I do that ? ''
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> is different .
Scott was talking in person .
In <unk> <unk> , it 's all public , so you all see this .
In this case , it saw a neighbor .
The next report said , `` I came to the place , I found the cube of garbage behind the house .
<unk> ? Yes . I lived ? Yes .
And I went around . I went home .
Good evening , sweet <unk> . ''
Quite simple .
This is great . It 's the confluence of the digital and the physical .
And it 's also a great example of the income of government to spread distributed .
But it 's also a great example of government as a platform .
And I do n't necessarily mean the technology technology definition .
I 'm talking about a platform for people to help and help others .
So a citizen helped another , but here the government had a key role .
connected to the two people .
And it could be connected with the government services of being needed , but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services .
When one neighbor helps another , they will <unk> communities .
If we call the animal control , that 's a lot of money .
One important thing that we need to think about government is that it is not the same as politics .
A lot of people understand it , but they think that one is the input of the other .
That our input to the government system is the vote .
How many times have you chosen a political leader ? We sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader , and then we hope that the government reflects our values and <unk> our needs , but then we do n't see changes .
That 's because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the <unk> <unk> layer .
So underneath it is what we call bureaucracy .
And we say that word with a lot of contempt .
But it 's that contempt that we have that belongs to us that we 've funded as something that operates in our against , that other thing , and we 're missing power .
People believe that politics is sensual .
If we want this institution to work , we 'll have to make bureaucracy sexy .
Because that 's where the true government work occurs .
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government .
That makes the <unk> movement .
Have you seen them ?
It 's a group of citizens worried that they 've written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the order of <unk> -- the financial reform project .
That 's not political activism , it 's bureaucratic activism .
And for those of us who have resigned ourselves to the government , it 's time to ask us what the world we want to leave with our children .
You have to see the enormous challenges that they need to face .
Do you really think that we will get to where we have to go without the institution that can act on behalf of all ?
We ca n't use government , we need to be more effective .
The good news is that with technology , it 's possible to rethink the root of governance so that it can expand the facility to civil society .
There 's a generation that grew up with the Internet , and it knows that it 's not that hard to act , you have to articulate the systems in the right way .
The average age of our members is 28 years old , so I 've got a lot of a greater generation than many of them .
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted .
They 're not giving that battle that everybody 's going to talk about ; they 're all going to talk about .
They can express your opinions at any same time and do it .
So when you face the government problem , you do n't really care about you to hear your voices .
They 're using their hands .
They set up the work to program applications that make applications better .
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
It can be cleaning up a hydrant , taking away off weeds and dumping a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside .
Of course , we could always have cleaned up those hydrants and lots of people .
But these applications are like a digital reminder that we 're not just consumers , we 're not just a government consumers that we pay taxes and we get services .
We are more than that : we are citizens .
And we 're not going to fix the government until we do n't support citizenship .
So I want to ask everybody here , when it comes to the important things that we need to do together , all of us together , we will be a crowd of voices , or also we will be a crowd of hands ?
Thank you .
This is for me a real honor .
I 've spent most of the time in jails and prisons and death row .
I 've spent most of my life in <unk> communities , in projects and places where there 's a lot of desperation .
And to be here at TED , you see and hearing this stimulus has given a lot of energy .
One of the things I 've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity .
And the things that are saying here have impact around the world .
Occasionally , if something comes from TED , it has a sense and a force that would n't have otherwise .
I mean this because I think identity is important .
Here we 've seen fantastic presentations .
And I think we 've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense , but if they 're taught with feeling , they can have a special meaning .
A doctor can do good things , whether it 's <unk> , it can get much more .
So I want to talk about the power of identity .
I did n't really learn this in the practice of the right , my job .
I learned from my grandmother .
I grew up in a traditional family 's family , dominated by a matriarch , which was my grandmother .
It was hard , it was strong , it was power .
It was the last word in the entire family discussion .
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home .
She was a daughter of people who had been slaves .
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia about 1840 .
She was born in the 1880s , and his experience with slavery ignores the way the world looked at .
She was hard , but she was also loving .
When I was a little girl , I looked at it , she was approaching me , and he gave me a good hug .
I was so strong that I could barely breathe , and then I got bored .
One or two hours later , I 'd come back to look at it , and I was like , `` Do you still feel my hug ? ''
And if I was told that I 'm not , I 'll hold again and if I read it , I was going to leave me in peace .
He had this human quality that would always want to be close to her .
The only problem is that I had 10 children .
My mother was the lowest of 10 .
Occasionally , when I was going to spend a time with her , it was n't easy to capture his time and his attention .
My cousins were running everywhere .
I remember when I was eight , nine years old , I woke up one morning , and I went to the room and there was all my cousins .
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me .
At first I thought it was a game .
Then he looked at her and smiles , but she was very serious .
After 15 , 20 minutes , she stood up , he pulled up , she took my hand and said , `` You see <unk> . The two are going to talk . ''
I remember this as if it was yesterday .
I will never forget it .
It took me out and said , `` <unk> , I 'll tell you something , but you ca n't tell anybody . ''
I said , `` Okay , Mama . ''
She said , `` Now <unk> you wo n't . '' I said , `` Sure . ''
And then I sat down , and he looked at me and said , `` I want you to know that I 've been looking at . ''
And he added , `` I think you 're special . ''
He said , `` I think you can do anything you want . ''
I will never forget it .
Then he said , `` I just want you to give me three things , <unk> . ''
I said , `` Sure , Mama . ''
And he said , `` The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother . ''
<unk> : `` She 's my <unk> , and you have to <unk> it forever . ''
As I loved my mom , I said , `` Yeah , Mama , I 'll do it . ''
Then he said to me , `` The second thing I want you to do is that you 're going to always do the right thing though the right thing is right . ''
I thought , and I said , `` Yeah , Mama . So I 'll do it . ''
Then , finally he said , `` The third thing I want you to do is they never <unk> alcohol . ''
I was nine years old , and I said , `` Yeah , Mama , I 'll do it . ''
I grew up in the field , in the South Side of rural . I have a younger brother and sister a smaller year .
When I was 14 15 , one day my brother came home with a bag of six beers , I do n't know where he pulled us up , grabbed me to my sister and me and left for the forest .
We 're just doing the crazy <unk> .
He took a taste of beer , he gave my sister to my sister , she took a little bit and offered me .
I said , `` No , no , no . All right . You follow , but I 'm not going to take beer . ''
My brother said , `` Come on . Today 's <unk> . And you always do the same as we do .
I took something , your sister too . Take a beer . ''
I said , `` No . I would n't feel good . You can follow . ''
Then my brother looked at me .
And he said , `` What happens ? You take a beer . ''
It came up with my eyes and went on , `` Oh , I 'm not going to be thinking about the conversation with Mama . ''
I said , `` But what are you talking about ? ''
He said , `` Hey , Mama , all the grandchildren are special . ''
I remained broken .
I have to admit to you .
I 'll tell you something that you probably should not say .
I know this will spread widely .
But I 'm 52 years old , and I can admit that I 've never taken a drop of alcohol .
I 'm not saying this thinking that 's a virtue ; I mean why it has identity .
When we create the right kind of identity , we say things about the other people who do n't really make sense .
We ca n't get them to do things that you ca n't believe .
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special .
My grandfather had been in prison for the ban .
My uncles died from age-related diseases .
And these were the things that , according to it , we had to engage it .
Now , try to talk about our criminal justice system .
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago .
In 1972 , there were 300,000 prisoners .
There is 2.3 million .
In the United States , we have the largest incarceration rate in the world .
We have seven million people in probation .
And this massive incarceration , in my view , has fundamentally changed our world .
In poor communities or black , they find so much despair , so much despair , determined by these facts .
One of the three black people between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or <unk> .
In urban <unk> all over the country , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington , 50 to 60 percent of all young people in color in jail or <unk> .
Our system is not just distorted in front of race , it 's also about poverty .
In this country , we have a criminal justice system that is a lot better if you 're rich and guilty , if you 're poor and innocent .
It 's not guilt , but wealth that affects the results .
And it seems that we feel very quiet .
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems .
We 're disconnected .
I find it interesting .
We 're looking at our work , some really curious developments .
In my state , in Alabama , as well as in other states , <unk> of rights forever if you have a criminal sentence .
Right now in Alabama , 34 percent of the black population of black has definitely lost the right to vote .
And if we projected it over the next 10 years , the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before the law of the law to vote .
We have this amazing silence .
I represent children .
Many of my clients are very young .
The United States is the only country in the world where it was sentence at <unk> in prison .
We have in this country prison for children , without the possibility of coming out .
We are now in process of some suits .
The only country in the world .
I play people on death row .
This issue of death row is interesting .
And in a sense , you 've got to think that the final question is , people deserve to die by <unk> <unk> ?
A very sensitive question .
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity .
There 's another way to look at it : it 's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes <unk> , but if we deserve to kill .
This is interesting .
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error .
From every nine people executed , it has identified one that is innocent and released from death row .
A mistake rate , amazing -- an innocent in every nine .
This is interesting .
We would n't allow them to be able to fly airplanes , if every nine to take off , you would have been crashing .
But somehow we <unk> the problem .
It 's not our problem .
It 's not our burden .
It 's not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these things .
I 'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill .
It 's interesting that in my classes with students in African-American history , I 'm talking about slavery .
I 'm talking to you about terrorism , the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to World War II .
We do n't really know a lot about this .
But for black Americans in this country , it was a defined time for terror .
In many communities , people were afraid to be <unk> .
They were worried about being bombarded .
The terror of terror was what their lives defined .
Now there are older people who come to me , and they say , `` Mr. Stevenson , you 're telling talks , narratives . <unk> people to stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism , after <unk> . ''
They ask me to say , `` No . Say we grew up with that . ''
The age of terrorism went on , obviously , with segregation and decades of Tom racial and <unk> .
In this country , we have a dynamic that we do n't like to talk about our problems .
We do n't like to talk about our story .
And that 's why we have n't understood the meaning of what we 've historically done .
And all of the time , they 're going to match each other .
We are constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
It costs us work to talk about races . I think it 's because we 're not willing to engage it with a process of truth and reconciliation .
In South Africa , people understood that they could n't overcome apartheid without a compromise with the truth and reconciliation .
In Rwanda , even before the genocide had this commitment , but in this country we have n't done .
I was in Germany giving lectures about death row .
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said , `` You know , you know , you 're pretty worrying to listen to what you say . ''
<unk> : `` We do n't have death row in Germany .
We 'll never be able to have it here . ''
The room was silent and a lady said , `` There is no way that we have our story , we can ever get into the systematic death of human beings .
It would be irrational that we , intentional and deliberately , could put us out to run people . ''
It 's going to be <unk> on this .
How would we feel in a world where a country like Germany , they 'd run to people , especially if they were in their most Jews ?
We could not tolerate it .
It would be irrational .
And yet , there 's this disconnect .
I think our identity is in danger .
If we actually do n't really care about these things that are so difficult , the positive and wonderful things are , however , involved .
We love innovation .
We 're fascinated by technology . <unk> creativity .
We love the entertainment .
But lately these realities are <unk> by suffering , abuse , degradation , <unk> .
In my view , we need to integrate both of these things .
lately we talk lately about the need for more hope , more engagement , more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world .
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor , the <unk> , the ones that never come to TED .
Think of them , in a way , something that 's within us .
It 's true that we have to believe in issues that we have n't seen .
So we are . In spite of being so rational , so committed to intellectual .
With innovation , with creativity , development is not just about brain ideas .
These things come from enrichment ideas as well by the convictions of the heart .
This <unk> of my mind with heart is what drives us not just in the brilliant and dazzling , but also in the dark and the hard thing .
We <unk> , the great Czech leader , talked about this .
He said , `` When we were in East Europe suffering from oppression , we wanted to do all sorts of things , but mainly what we needed was hope , orientation for spirit , an willingness to be on places of despair and witness . ''
Well , that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think , which is still in communities like TED , has to be engaged .
There is no connection to technology and design , which allows us to become truly human , if we do n't pay attention to poverty , to exclusion , to inequality , to injustice .
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make an identity much more challenging than if we ignore these things .
We go back to them .
I had the great privilege , being a very young lawyer , to meet Rosa Parks .
These women were together just to speak .
Occasionally , the lady <unk> to me , to say , `` <unk> , comes the lady here . We 're going to get to talk .
Do you want to come and listen ? ''
I was like , `` Yes ma'am . I do want . ''
So she said , `` Well what are you going to do when you come ? ''
I answered , `` <unk> . ''
So I was going and I would just hear them .
It was very <unk> , very <unk> .
And in one occasion , I was there , listening to these ladies , and after a couple of hours , Mrs. Parks went to me and said , `` Now , <unk> . Give me that is that idea of equal justice .
Tell me what you 're trying to do . ''
And I started giving my speech .
I said , `` Well , we 're trying to question injustice .
We 're trying to help those who have been convicted .
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration .
We try to end the sentences of life , without parole for children .
We try to do something about death row .
We 're trying to reduce the population in jails .
We 're trying to end up with massive <unk> . ''
I gave it all my best speech , and at the end of the end , he looked at me and said , `` Hmm , um . ''
And he said , `` <unk> out , very exhausted . ''
At that time , Mrs. <unk> leaned , he put my finger on the face and said , `` That 's why you have to be very , very brave . ''
I think that actually , the TED community has to be much more <unk> .
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges , those problems , that suffering .
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others .
I 've learned some very simple things in my work .
I 've been educated with simple things .
I 've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than we 've ever made .
I think that 's true for everybody on the planet .
I 'm convinced that if somebody says a lie , it 's not because they 're a liar .
I 'm sure if somebody takes something that does n't belong , it 's not a thief .
Even if someone kills another , it 's not that it 's a murderer .
So I think there 's a basic dignity in the people who should be respected by the law .
I also think that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
That 's not .
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice .
And finally , I think , even though it 's very dramatic , very beautiful , very <unk> , very stimulating , we ca n't judge our technology , for our designs , not for our intellectual and rational capacity .
Ultimately the character of a society is judging the character of a society , not by the way that they treat the rich and powerful and privileged , but by the way they treat the poor , the <unk> , the prisoners .
Because it 's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are .
Sometimes I feel <unk> . I 'm going to end with a story .
Sometimes I do too much force .
<unk> tired , like everyone .
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> .
I 've been representing these guys who have been convicted of the severity of it .
I go to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 , that they 've been <unk> so that they were <unk> .
And I start thinking , how can it be ?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not ?
The judge 's <unk> as an adult , but I see a child .
One night later , I was awake thinking -- `` Oh my God , if the judge can become something you 're not , have to have magical powers .
Yes , <unk> , the judge has the <unk> powers .
You should ask for something .
As I was very late , I could n't think right , but I started working on a <unk> .
He had a 14 client , a small , poor man .
I started working on <unk> , with a <unk> that said , `` <unk> so that my 14-year-old black client is treated as a 75 , executive background , executive from a corporation . ''
In the <unk> , I put out there had been <unk> behavior in the accusation , in the behavior of the police and in the process .
There was a bold line about how in this country there is no ethics , but a lack of ethics .
The next morning , I woke up thinking that crazy <unk> would be a dream , or actually wrote it ?
For my horror , not only had it <unk> it , but he had sent it to court .
It took about two months , I had forgotten it .
And finally , I decided -- Oh my God , I have to go to court for this stupid case .
I got into the car , and I felt really overwhelmed , overwhelmed .
I went into the court car .
I thought this would be very difficult and pitiful .
I finally got off the car . I walked into the court .
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a bigger black man ; I was the Stone <unk> man .
When he saw me , he came up to me and said , `` Who is you ? ''
I said , `` I 'm a lawyer . '' He replied , `` Is you a lawyer ? '' I said yes .
So I approached me and hugged me .
And I whispered it into the ear .
He said , `` I 'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you now that that was <unk> .
That 's deeply connected to my interior , with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope .
Well , I went into the hearings room .
When you enter , the judge saw me .
And he said , `` Mr. Stevenson , you wrote this bold bold ? ''
I said , `` Yes , Mr. left . '' And we started to argue .
People started getting . They were all upset .
I was the one that was written that crazy .
They got the <unk> prosecutors , auxiliary .
Suddenly , without knowing how , the room was full of people . Everyone 's infuriated because we 're talking about races , because we 're talking about poverty , because we talked about inequality .
With the corner of the eye , I was going to see what I was going and came .
He would look out the window and she would hear all that <unk> .
I was walking over here and there .
Finally , this old black black man , in the face of concern , walked into the room and sat behind me , almost on the lawyers table .
About 10 minutes later , the judge <unk> a break .
During the break , a sheriff 's assistant showed me because the superintendent had entered the room .
The assistant <unk> over the old black black .
And he said , `` Jimmy , what do you do in the room of audiences ? ''
And the old black lady stood up , looked at the assistant , looked at me and said , `` I went into this audience of audiences to tell this young man to keep his view on the <unk> objective . ''
I 've come to TED today because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large , but it folds into justice .
That we ca n't truly be human beings if we do n't care about human rights and for dignity .
That our survival is linked to the other .
That our visions of technology , design , entertainment and creativity must bind the brotherhood and compassion and justice .
And above all , those of you who are sharing this , I just want to tell you to keep your view on the <unk> objective .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : You just heard and see a evident in the audience , of this community , to help in your purposes , to do something .
Something that 's not a check . What can we do ?
BS : There are several opportunities nearby .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there 's going to be a <unk> of this spring , which is going to be done to <unk> the funds that are spent in punishment today .
For example , here in California , they 're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years , a billion dollars .
And despite this , 46 percent of the murder cases did not prevent them in arrests .
56 percent of rapes come in .
Here 's a chance of change .
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> to make the law , to safety .
I think there 's a very close opportunity .
CA : There 's been a huge decline in crime in America , in the last three decades .
Part of the explanation is that it has to do with the highest rate of incarceration incarceration .
What would you say that it 's like this ?
BS : Actually , the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable .
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not for crimes of violence .
It 's the wrong War on drugs .
That 's why this dramatic increase emerges in the prison population .
And we were allowed to convince the rhetoric of punishment .
We have three legal causes to bring people into life chain -- to steal a bicycle , by small crimes against property , instead of making those resources to their victims .
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less .
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody .
I think that 's the orientation that has to change .
CA : <unk> , you 've excited us here today .
You 're very inspiring .
Thank you so much for having come to TED . Thank you .
<unk> : They grow the threats for Bin Laden 's death .
<unk> 2 : <unk> in Somalia . <unk> 3 : The police throws spray .
<unk> 4 : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 6 : <unk> <unk> : 65 dead .
<unk> 8 : <unk> <unk> : <unk> .
Several <unk> : <unk> , massive , massive , <unk> .
Yes . <unk> . <unk> . Egypt . Egypt .
Crisis . Death . <unk> .
Oh my God !
Peter Diamandis : These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months . <unk> could be for the last six days or for the last six years .
The idea is that media media prefer <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to them .
And that responds to a very good reason .
In every second of our senses , our senses are getting much more data than the brain can process .
And as nothing matters to us more than survive , the first stop , all of that data is an old excerpt from the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
The amygdala is our early warning detector , the danger detector .
<unk> and records all the information is looking for something in the environment that could get hurt .
So that 's why a <unk> of stories would look at the negative .
That old press saying , `` If there 's blood , it sells , '' it 's very true .
And since all digital devices give us news , the seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , it 's not surprising that we 're pessimistic .
It 's not surprising that people think that the world will be wrong with worse .
But maybe not that .
Maybe , instead , what happens is we get <unk> .
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is accelerating so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades .
I 'm not saying that we do n't have our good problems : climate change , endangered species , water scarcity and energy ; we have .
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems , and at the long time , we just put them up with them .
So let 's take that happening in the last century to see where we go .
In the last hundred years , the average of life has more than doubled , average per capita income has tripled in the entire world .
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times .
Also , the cost of food , from electricity , transportation and communications , has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times .
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history .
And Charles suggested that global literacy went from 25 percent over 80 percent over the last 130 years .
We 're really living an extraordinary time .
A lot of people forget it .
And we still follow higher expectations .
In fact , we redefined meaning of poverty .
Think about it today in the United States , a lot of the people who live under the poverty have electricity , water , bathrooms , refrigerators , television , mobile , mobile .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the past century , the <unk> of the planet would never have dreamed of such luxury .
It 's a lot of this technology is technology and , lately , its exponential growth .
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> into information technology jumps on this curve , Moore 's Law , and doubling the price performance in about 12 to 24 months .
That 's why the mobile phone have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the 1970s .
Now look at this curve .
It 's Moore 's Law for the last hundred years .
I want you to look at two things on this curve .
First , the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times , in war and peace , in recession , in depression and booming .
It 's the resulting <unk> computers used to build faster computers .
It does n't stop any big challenges .
And although it 's <unk> in a law on the left , it goes up .
The growth rate of technology is getting faster and faster .
And on this curve , to Moore 's Law , there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today .
The cloud computing , that my friends of Autodesk , the 3D printing , sensors and networks , robotics , 3D printing , and their ability to democratize it and distribute synthetic production on the planet , synthetic biology , the fuel , vaccines and food , digital medicine , tapir and A.I . .
I mean , how many of you saw the victory on `` Jeopardy , '' of IBM ?
It was epic .
I looked for the newspapers the best headline I would have .
And I loved this : `` Watson <unk> <unk> human opponents . ''
`` Jeopardy '' is not an easy game .
It plays with the nuances of human language .
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , available for all of them on the cell phone .
Four years ago , here at TED , Ray Kurzweil and I , we launched a new university called <unk> University .
We teach these technologies to our students , and in particular , how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
And every year we asked them to release a company , or a product or service , that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade .
Think about that , the fact that a group of students can actually impact a billion people 's life .
Thirty years ago that would have <unk> absurd .
We can now point out a <unk> of companies that have already done .
When I think about creating abundance , it does n't mean creating fancy life for each of the planet on the planet ; it 's about creating a life of what we can .
It 's about taking that that is scarce and making it plentiful .
You see , scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources .
I 'll give you an example .
It 's a story about Napoleon 's story .
He 's the guy on the left .
He invited dinner the king of <unk> .
The troops of Napoleon had covered with covered in silver , and the same Napoleon in covered with gold .
But the king of <unk> , she ate on aluminum .
You see , aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet ; it was worth more than the gold and the platinum .
And for that reason , the tip of the Washington divide to Washington is aluminum .
You see , even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the mass of the Earth , it does n't come like pure metal .
It 's tied by oxygen and <unk> them .
But then he got <unk> and made something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk> .
So let 's look at this analogy towards the future .
Let 's think about energy shortage .
Ladies and gentlemen , we 're on a planet bathed in 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes .
It 's not about scarcity , it 's about access .
And there 's good news .
This year , for the first time , the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated from diesel : earthquake earthquake , <unk> versus 17 rupees .
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year .
Last month , MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade , in <unk> parts of the United States , solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average .
And if we have abundance of energy , we also have plenty of water .
So let 's talk about the wars in the water .
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the spacecraft Voyager on Earth , 1990 , after Saturn happened ?
So , brought a famous picture . How was it called ?
`` A pale blue dot . ''
Because we live on a planet .
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water .
Yes , <unk> percent is salt water , two percent is ice , and we fight for 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there is also a hope .
It 's a technology available not in 10 years , but right now .
It comes the nanotechnology , the nanomaterials .
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning , one of the innovators in the <unk> -- I 'd like to share with you , gave me permission to do that -- his technology called <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator .
It 's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any <unk> salt , contaminated water , a <unk> , at least two cents a gallon .
The Coca-Cola president has just thought that I 'm going to make an important test for hundreds of these units in the developing world .
If that comes out well , and I have full confidence in that this is , Coca-Cola is going to implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet .
This is an innovative innovation of this technology that exists today .
And we 've seen it on mobile phones .
My God , we 're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013 .
Think about that , that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya that the President Reagan have 25 years ago .
And from having a smartphone with Google , it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago .
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted .
Better than that , the things that you and I have paid tens of thousands of thousands of dollars <unk> , images , images , books , books , <unk> technology , <unk> technology , are now <unk> and lost market value with mobile phones .
Maybe the best coming up when it comes to health applications .
Last month , I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation , something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> , 10 million dollars .
We 're challenging the equipment around the world to combine these technologies into a mobile device with which they speak , and because it has A.I . , you can coughing , you can get blood from your finger .
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team .
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , where the burden of morbidity is 25 percent , and there 's 1.3 percent of health workers .
Now , when this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that does not recognize , you know , the <unk> of the health and , in the first place , prevent the pandemic to happen .
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance .
I call it the <unk> billion .
The white lines here are the population .
We 've just passed the mark of the seven billion .
By the way , the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health .
In 2010 , we had less than two billion people online , connected .
By 2020 , going from two billion to five billion users of the Internet .
Three billion minds ever heard that you add to the global conversation .
What do these people want ?
What should anyone have ?
And instead of an economic collapse we have the largest economic injection of history .
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy .
And the highest health care thanks to <unk> , from a better education with the Khan Academy , and because of the use of prints in 3D and to computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before .
What can us give us 3,000 million more members of humanity , healthy , productive healthy ?
What about voices ever before heard ?
What if we give the oppressed , wherever you are , a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time ?
What about the <unk> billion ?
What if they 're contributions that we ca n't predict ?
Something that I learned with the X Prize is that small teams , guided by their passion with a clear target , can do extraordinary things -- things that they could only do the big corporations and governments .
I 'm going to end by sharing a story that really got me excited .
There 's a program that maybe some of you know .
It 's called <unk> .
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle .
It 's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein .
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality .
It 's a very important thing in medical research .
And so far , it was a <unk> problem .
They 've played with this college teachers , among others .
And hundreds of thousands of people went together and started to play it .
And it has been shown today that the machinery of human patterns in human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers .
Ladies and gentlemen , what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power as people to take the great challenges of the planet .
We have the tools with this exponential technology .
We have the passion for <unk> .
We have the <unk> capital .
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of the great challenges and doing what we should do .
We have in front of these extraordinary decades .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about a very small idea .
The <unk> of the point of departure .
And as the idea can be explained in a minute , I 'll give you three examples to make time .
The first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my heroes .
He was here , as you know , in 1835 .
Maybe they thought that `` finches , '' but it did n't .
They actually collect fish .
And he described one of them as a very `` common . ''
It was grouper .
It caught it too far to the 1880s .
The fish is the Red List .
But we 've heard this story many times , on Galapagos and other places , so that 's nothing special about it .
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos .
We still think they 're <unk> .
The brochures still say they 're still intact .
So what happens here ?
The second story , it illustrates another concept : the shift around the waist .
Because I was there in 1971 , studying a lagoon in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa .
I thought I could do it .
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there .
This is my first exhibition to the sun .
The lagoon was surrounded by palms , and as you can see , from a mangroves .
There were <unk> from about 20 centimeters , the <unk> of black beard .
And the fishery of this tilapia was very abundant , and it was going on for a good time , so he won more than the average in Ghana .
When I was there 27 years later , the number of fish had halved .
<unk> at five centimeters .
<unk> a genetic pressure .
There were still fish .
In a way , they were still happy .
And the fish were still happy to be there .
I mean , nothing in changed , but everything has changed .
My third story is that I was in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia .
In the 1970s -- well , it started in <unk> Europe , did a lot of development projects .
<unk> development was supposed to impose the countries that already had 100,000 fishermen , <unk> industrial fisheries .
And this boat , pretty ugly , called the <unk> 4 .
I went out to fish in it , and we did studies in the southern Sea Sea Sea and , especially in the Java Sea .
What we captured there was a little bit of <unk> .
<unk> , now , the bottom of the sea .
Ninety percent of what we captured in were sponges , other animals that are at the bottom .
And most of the fish are tiny blobs on remains , remains that are <unk> fish .
In short , the sea bottom came to the deck and then they launched .
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
In a year , you do a study , and then you start commercial fishing .
The bottom line of being a solid background of soft coral , in this case , to be a <unk> .
This is a dead turtle .
They did n't eat them . <unk> them because they were dead .
We once captured a living .
I was still not <unk> .
So they wanted to kill her because it was a good food .
This mountain of remains is what you collect the fishermen , every time you go to an area where you 've never fish fish .
But it does n't have documented .
We turn the world , but we do n't remember it .
He <unk> the point of starting , the new level , without remembering what was there .
If you look at this happens something like this .
On the y-axis , we have good things : biodiversity , number of killer whales , the <unk> of the country , the water supply .
And that changes over time . Changes because people do things with <unk> .
Every generation to use images received at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward .
The difference is that they perceive loss .
But they do n't perceive the loss that happened before .
You can analyze the discovery of change .
And in the end , I keep some miserable remains .
And that , largely , is what we want to do now .
We want to keep things that are not yet , or they 're not what they were .
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies kill people kill animals without knowing what they 've done to a few generations later .
Because , obviously , an animal which is very abundant , before we go extinct , it 's rare .
You do n't lose plentiful animals .
You lose animals .
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss .
Over time , we focus on big animals , and in a sea synonymous with big fish .
They become little frequent because we take them .
Over time , there 's a few fish , but we think that 's the starting point .
And the question is , why do we accept this ?
Well , because we do n't know it was different .
In fact , a lot of people , scientists , <unk> that were very different .
They will because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect to have the evidence .
For example , the anecdote that some present , like Captain such , and so I looked at a lot of fish in this area ca n't be used , or usually they do n't use the general fishing scientists , because it 's not `` scientist . ''
So we have a situation where people do n't know the past , even though we lived in <unk> societies , because they do n't rely on the sources of the past .
Hence the huge paper that can be a protected marine area .
Because with marine areas , we really <unk> the past .
<unk> the past that people ca n't conceive of because the starting point has been run , and it 's very low .
That 's for people who can see a protected marine zone and can benefit from the vision that provides , which allows them to erase their starting point .
And what about people who ca n't do it because they do n't have access , like people in the Midwest , for example ?
I think there 's the arts and cinema , maybe you can fill in the vacuum . The simulation .
This is a simulation from Chesapeake Bay .
A long time ago there were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay , 500 years ago .
And you may have noticed that nuances and <unk> are like `` Avatar . ''
And if you think of `` Avatar , '' if you think why people were so moved with the film -- I mean , I 'm going to talk about the story of <unk> , why do you deal with images ?
Because it raises something that , in a sense , has been lost .
So my recommendation is , the only one I 'll give , is Cameron II in the water .
Thank you very much .
Hi . I 'm Kevin <unk> , the YouTube trends manager , and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form .
It 's true .
So today we 'll see why videos are doing viral and how important it has to do .
We all want to be stars : celebrities , singers , comedians -- when I was younger , that looked something very , very hard .
But today , the web is making any of us , or our actions , copper in a part of our global culture .
Anyone can be famous on the Internet in a <unk> .
And over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute .
And , of those , only a small percentage of them gets viral , they get countless visits and wins cultural momentum .
How does that happen ?
Three things : makers of trends , communities and printing factor .
Okay , let 's start .
<unk> <unk> : Oh my God , my God .
Oh my God !
Wow .
<unk> , <unk> !
KA : Last year , <unk> <unk> published this video , outside his house in Yosemite National Park .
In 2010 , it was seen 23 million times .
This chart shows the views on the rise of last summer last summer .
<unk> was not going on to make a viral video .
I just wanted to share a double rainbow .
That 's what you do if you call Yosemite Mountain <unk> .
There was a lot of videos in nature .
This video was published in January .
So what happened here ?
It was Jimmy Kimmel .
Jimmy Kimmel published this tweet that <unk> the video to the popularity .
The creators of trends like Jimmy Kimmel , they present us new and interesting things to the wider audience .
Rebecca Black : It 's Friday , Friday . You 've got to start Friday . You all want to get on Friday . KA : <unk> , Friday . You 've got Friday . KA : You wo n't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video , I hope .
<unk> from Rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year .
They saw it about 200 million times this year .
This graph shows the frequency frequency .
Like , `` <unk> rainbow '' -- this video seemed to have emerged from nothing .
So what happened this day ?
Well , it was Friday , it 's true .
And if you ask those other peaks , they 're also Friday .
But what happened this day , this particular Friday ?
Well , I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it .
Michael J. Nelson , <unk> Science , was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter .
But what 's important is that a person or a group of <unk> , to take a point of view and share it with a wider audience , accelerating the process .
So , this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts to talk about it and doing things .
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube .
Only in the first seven days , there was a parody for each other days .
Unlike the one-way <unk> entertainment , this community participation is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with that .
`` Cat Cat '' is an animation repetitive with a chord with a chord .
That 's what it is .
This year you saw about 50 million times .
And if you think that 's weird , you know that there 's a three hours of three hours that has seen four million times .
Until the cats saw this video .
And there are cats that you saw other cats to see the video .
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community .
There was <unk> .
Somebody did an old version of the old one .
And then it was international .
All of a sudden , a whole <unk> community came out that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all form .
Because we do n't just enjoy , we participate .
Who could have predicted something like this ?
Who might have predicted `` <unk> rainbow '' or Rebecca `` Cat Cat '' ?
What the script might have been writing about this situation ?
In a world where you 're going up two days per minute , just that truly unique and unexpected thing can do it , so that these things have done .
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who 's going to protest against <unk> tickets in New York , I admit I was not interested .
Casey <unk> : I got a ticket for <unk> , but there are often obstacles that keep you <unk> properly by <unk> .
KA : Thank you , thank you as a surprise and your humor , Casey <unk> , that five million watched and understand their idea .
So this approach is worth all the new things that we do creatively .
And all of this leads to a big question .
<unk> <unk> : What does this mean ?
<unk> .
KA : What does this mean ?
<unk> , creative communities , totally unexpected , are features of a new type of media , of a new culture , which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity .
As I said earlier , one of the current celebrities of the world , Justin Bieber , started on YouTube .
You do n't borrow permission to express your ideas .
Now we 're all a little masters of our pop culture .
These are not the characteristics of the old media , barely are the current media , but will define the entertainment of the future .
Thank you .
This is not a finished story .
It 's a puzzle that 's still going into .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning the work of a whole life .
It 's a poet , a playwright , a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country .
<unk> as the communist come into <unk> , facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain .
The words , for so long , friends , are now fun .
It was quiet in silence .
He died .
He 's my grandfather .
I never met him .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story .
My task was not to let it have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> it , but it was <unk> .
The next part of the puzzle is a boat at dawn <unk> quietly .
My mother , <unk> , was so only 18 years old when his father died , and a <unk> marriage and two small girls .
For her , life had been meant : the escape from her family and a new life in Australia .
It was inconceivable for her that I could n't do it .
And after a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat slid into the sea with a <unk> ship .
Every adults knew the risks .
The biggest fear was pirates , rape and death .
Like most adults , my mother carried a little bit with poison .
If you could catch it , first we took my sister and me , and then she and my grandmother .
My first memories are from that boat , the constant rate of the engine , the bow diving into every wave , and the vast horizon and empty horizon .
I do n't remember the pirates who came back several times , but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat , or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours .
But I do remember the lights on the oil shelf in front of the Malaysia coast , and the young man who collapsed , and he was going to finish the journey was too much for him , and the first apple I tried , given by the men on the platform .
No apple had later the same taste .
After three months in a refugee camp , <unk> in Melbourne .
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations , shaping a new life together .
We set up in <unk> , a suburb of workers whose population is composed of immigrants .
Unlike the middle of the middle class , whose existence I did not know , in <unk> , there was no sense of the right .
The smells that came from the shops were from the rest of the world .
And the fragments of <unk> English became among people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
My mother worked in farms , then in an assembly line of cars , working six days , double turn .
Yet , I found time to study English and get a degree in IT .
We were poor .
All of the dollars were assigned to , and it was worth extra on English and mathematics , they would n't matter what you should take away , which was usually new , and it 's always a second .
Two <unk> pairs for school , one to hide the holes in the other .
A school uniform to the ankles , because it had to last six years .
And there was <unk> <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> eyes and some graffiti , `` Asians , come home . ''
It 's home , where ?
Something in me will be <unk> .
I was compiling determination and a voice that said , `` I 'm going to get you . ''
My mother , my sister and I <unk> in the same bed .
My mother was exhausted every night , but we told us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother at home .
My mother suffered nightmares , all of the boat .
And my job was to be awake until his nightmares were going to be awake in order to <unk> it .
She opened a computer shop , then he studied to be <unk> and opened up another business .
And women came with their stories about men who could n't make the transition , angry and <unk> , <unk> , trapped between two worlds .
They looked for subsidies and sponsors .
And they created centers .
I lived in parallel worlds .
In one , it was the classical and classical , relentless student with what I 'm going to do .
On the other , I was very <unk> in poor lives , tragically <unk> by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
But many people received help over the years .
And for that job , when I was studying my last year of lawyer , I picked me the young Australian man in the year .
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other , but his edges did n't fit .
As I read , <unk> anonymous , I was now so <unk> , refugee and social activist , invited talking to sites that I had never heard of , and in houses whose existence had never imagined .
I did n't know the protocols .
I did n't know how to use the covered .
I did n't know how to talk about wine .
I did n't know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to retreat into the routines and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters and two daughters , as they did for nearly 20 years , <unk> on the day of every single one and running <unk> , three still in the same bed .
And I told my mom I could n't do that .
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got up the boat .
The `` not '' had been an option .
`` Get on , '' he said , `` You 're not what you 're not . ''
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and the <unk> .
And the more frankly he talked about , the more it was <unk> to speak .
I met people from all the roads in life , many of them doing what they loved , living on the frontier of what we could .
And although I finished my bachelor 's degree , I realized I could n't stay in a career of lawyer .
There had to be another piece of the puzzle .
And I realized at the same time that it 's okay to be a stranger , a newly arrived , new on the scene -- and not just that it 's fine , but it is something that is something that will be grateful , perhaps a gift of the boat .
Because inside it can easily mean <unk> , it can easily mean to embrace the assumptions of your province .
I gave enough steps outside of my happy place to know that , yes , that the world is being bent , but not the way we fear .
They would have been <unk> that they were n't <unk> .
There was an energy there , a relentless optimism , a mix of humility and courage .
So I kept my intuition .
<unk> a small group of people for those who the motto `` ca n't do '' was a compelling challenge .
For one year , we did n't have a penny .
At the end of every day , it was a giant soup pot that we all shared .
They 're going to be <unk> at all the night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but some brilliant , and we 're going to open up .
I took the decision to move to the U.S .
after a single journey .
My hunches again .
Three months later , I had moved , and the adventure kept .
Before I finished , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered .
Life had n't changed for centuries .
His father died shortly after she was born .
The mother grew up alone .
At age 17 became a <unk> whose mother was beating her .
Without her husband 's support , he caused a stir by the <unk> and he had the cause her , and much more <unk> caused when he won .
The <unk> ca n't be done wrong .
I was in the shower in a hotel in Sydney , when she died , to 1,000 miles in Melbourne .
I looked through the shower 's <unk> and I watched it on the other side .
I knew I 'd come to say .
My mother called minutes later .
Days later , we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her casket .
We tell them stories and we make sure that we were still with it .
At night , a monk came in and told us that he had to close the coffin .
My mother asked us to raise his hand .
And I asked the monk , `` Why his hand is hot , and the rest of the body so cold ? ''
`` Because you 've taken your hand since the morning , '' he said .
`` You have n't <unk> it . ''
If there 's a nerve in our family , that runs through women .
Since we were and how life formed us , we can now see that the men who had reached our lives would have frustrated us .
The defeat would be easily <unk> .
Now I want to have my own kids , and I wonder about the boat .
Who could wish that for itself ?
However , I fear the privilege of how easy , the right .
Can I give you a bow in their lives , diving brave in every wave , the <unk> pace of the engine , the vast horizon that does n't guarantee anything ?
I do n't know .
But if I could give it and see them safe , I would do it .
<unk> <unk> and also the mother 's mother is right here in the fourth or fifth row .
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago .
I was in the desert , under the starry sky , with the Sufi singer <unk> Ali .
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the time of the former Indian epic .
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car , and they would go through the sky .
Now we do it with airplanes .
At that time , when I <unk> , the great prince of <unk> , he would pull out an arch and a <unk> on the ground , she got water .
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines .
The conclusion that we took out was that the machinery had replaced to the magic .
And that was a lot of fun .
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk> .
I would take this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I did n't have the camera , if I could n't <unk> my friends .
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic to do it , not to kill her .
My grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk> .
And this was a <unk> piece of 50 , it was for me the most magic thing .
It became a golden door to a world filled with images , of pirates and <unk> in my imagination .
I had the feeling that mobile phones , the luxury clocks and the cameras keep them out .
<unk> our inspiration .
And so I launched , I came up with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic , instead of her .
<unk> books since the 16 years .
So when I saw the iPad , I saw a storytelling device that can connect the readers of the entire world .
You can know how we take the book .
Where we are .
<unk> the text with the image , animation , sound and touch .
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk> .
But what does that work ?
I 'm about to launch <unk> , an interactive application for iPad .
He says , `` Put your fingers on every light . ''
And so -- he says , `` This box belongs to ... '' I write my name .
And so I go back a book character .
In several moments , I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live from the GPS -- that 's led to me .
My inner girl is excited about all these possibilities .
I 've talked a lot about magic .
And I do n't mean <unk> and dragons , but to that childhood magic , to those ideas that are <unk> .
For some reason , fireflies in a bottle always turned great .
So , over here , we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies .
And really , they light up your path in what addition of the book .
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk> .
So here , every book , and every world turns into a <unk> that I move towards this magic device , inside the device .
And this opens up a map .
In every book of fantasy , there have always been maps , but it 's been static maps .
This is a map that grows , <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book .
In certain points of the book , it unfolds .
Now I 'm going to go in .
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time .
These are the <unk> .
We 've all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside of India know their Indian counterparts , the <unk> ?
These poor <unk> have been trapped in Indra cameras for millennia , in an old and wet book .
So we 're bringing it back in a contemporary child story .
In a story that comes to current issues like the environmental crisis .
And , talking about the environmental crisis , one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked up , glued to their PCs , they have n't left the outside world .
But now with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside , take the camera or the iPad , and you collect images from different natural objects .
As a child , I had a lot of collections : sticks , stones , pebbles and shells .
For some reason , kids do n't .
So to bring this child out of childhood , you have to go out and , in a chapter , you would take a picture to a flower and then <unk> it .
In another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then tagging .
So it 's created a digital collection of pictures that you can put on the Web .
A little boy from London puts a picture of a fox , and he says , `` Oh , I saw a fox . ''
A child in India says , `` I saw a monkey today . ''
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taken .
Within the interactions of connection between magic , Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities .
So in the next book , we frame that we had an interaction where you come out with the iPad , and the video on and through augmented , you see a group of cartoons that appear on the plants inside the house .
At a moment the screen is full of leaves .
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so that you can read the rest of the book .
We 're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology gets closer to each other .
It <unk> the energy of the sun .
We 're getting closer to our kids and ourselves to the natural world and that magic and joy and child love that we sit through through a simple story .
Thank you .
I 'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> fail .
And I think , really , that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients .
And one of the things we did at <unk> University was <unk> to a director of listening .
And not in a very scientific way , she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients , family and known : What happens ?
How can we help it ?
And we tend to think , this is one of the biggest problems that everybody , or maybe not all , but most of the projects of <unk> fail , because we stop listening .
This is my Wi-Fi scale . It 's very simple .
It 's got a doorknob and off off .
Every morning I get on .
And yes , I have a challenge as you can see .
And I got the challenge to get to 95 kilograms .
But it 's so simple , that every time I connect to , it sends my information to Google Health .
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him too . So he can see what my weight problem is , not at the same time when he needs <unk> assistance or any urgency of that style , but to see it backwards .
But there 's another thing .
Like some of you know , I have over 4,000 people on Twitter .
So , every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before coming up to my car , people start to talk to me : <unk> , I think you need a light lunch .
That 's the best thing that can happen , because it 's pressure pressure to help patients , because it could be used for obesity , and also for patients to stop smoking .
On the other hand , it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health .
From the next week .
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device .
And people will be able to be able to , from their houses , take their blood pressure , <unk> their doctor , and share it with others , for example , for 100 dollars .
This is the point where patients assume a position , they turn off the control and being captains and to be the captains of their own boat , but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face , as the firing of <unk> care costs , the <unk> of demand and other issues .
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team .
And they can do it with techniques like these , but also by crowdsourcing .
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video .
We all have <unk> <unk> in cars .
Maybe we have them in our cell phones .
We know perfectly where ATMs are in <unk> .
And also where they 're all <unk> .
And of course , we can find chains of fast food .
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient ?
We asked , but no one did .
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saving lives right now .
What we did was make crowdsourcing in the Netherlands .
We created a website , and we asked the audience to say , `` If you look at a <unk> , please <unk> , <unk> where , '' and when it 's open , they 're already opening up in terms of office , and others are closed .
And over 10,000 <unk> were introduced in the Netherlands .
The next step was to look for the app for that .
And we made an app for the iPad .
We created an app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> .
And every time you 're in the city of <unk> and someone collapses , you can use your iPhone , and the next few weeks , you can use your cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> , what you can save lives .
And from today , I 'd like to present this one , not just like <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also as <unk> .
And we 'd like to <unk> it globally .
We 're talking about all the colleagues in the world , in other universities , to help us find and work and act as a center for the crowdsourcing of <unk> worldwide .
Every time you 're on vacation and someone collapses , you can be a relative or somebody in front of you , you can find it .
I also wanted to invite companies across the world that could help us shoot these <unk> .
It could be <unk> services or mobile people , for example , to see if the <unk> that 's shown is still in place .
Please help us into this and not only improve health , but to take control of it .
Thank you very much .
I 'm here to share 'my reasons .
Or is it <unk> photography ?
Because of course , it 's photographs that you ca n't take with your cameras .
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
I mixed with my passionate passion for the drawing , but it was a little bit different because I used the camera , the process was in planning .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends up when you click the <unk> .
To me , photography had more than seeing with being in the right place , at the right time .
It seemed like anybody could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , a process I would start by pressing the <unk> .
<unk> like this : a construction on a very <unk> road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And , despite that , it holds a level of realism .
Or pictures like these -- dark and colorful at the same time , but with the common goal to maintain the level of realism .
And when I say realism <unk> , I mean .
Because , of course , it 's not something I can do , but I always want it to seem to be captured in a way as a photograph .
You know , you 're going to have to think about a moment to discover the trick .
It has more than to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment .
But what is the trick that makes them seem real ?
Are you all the details or the colors ?
Do you make light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the illusion is perspective .
But in the end it is about our way to interpret the world , and how you can perceive it in a two-dimensional surface .
It 's not really about whether it 's realistic , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the foundations are very simple .
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality .
I 'll show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects , something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world .
But combined with a certain way you can create something that still seems three-dimensional , as if it existed .
But at the same time , we know it does n't exist .
So we pretend to the brain because the brain does n't accepts the fact that that does n't really make sense .
And I see the same process by combining the photographs .
It really involves different realities .
And the things that make a picture seem realistic , I think that they are those in which we do n't even think about -- the things that surround us in our everyday lives .
But when you combine pictures , it 's very important to consider it , because otherwise something will be wrong .
So I 'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective .
Second , the photos are combining the same kind of light .
And these two pictures meet with these requirements , they were taken by the same height and with the same kind of light .
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect union .
It has to be impossible to see where the image made .
This is another example .
Now , you might think that this is the image of a landscape , and the bottom is manipulated .
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places .
I think it 's easier to create a place to find a place that is because you do n't need to put the ideas in danger .
But it requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to <unk> , to find the different locations for the puzzle pieces .
For example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
<unk> are a different location .
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk> well .
And yes , I even made a red red house at the top of the island to get more Swedish .
So to make a realistic result of me , I think he does have planning .
You always start with a sketch , an idea .
Then you have to combine the different photographs .
And here every piece is pretty well meant for .
If you do a good job when you take the pictures , the outcome can be very beautiful and very realistic .
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination .
Thank you .
I 'm going to start showing a slide of technology , very boring .
Please , if you can put it .
It 's a diagram that I took from a folder .
I 'm not very interested in showing you the details , but the general look .
It 's an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
What 's interesting about this is that this one , like many others that we usually see , is a straight line on a logarithmic scale .
In other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance .
I 'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves .
Here 's something weird here .
And that 's what I 'm going to talk about .
Please turn on the lights .
It 's more intensity , because writing on paper .
Why do we plot technology curves at <unk> scales ?
The answer is that if I draw it on a normal curve where , let 's say , these are the years , or some unit of time , and this would be any measure of the technology that I 'd like to plot , the diagram look ridiculous .
It would be something like this .
It does n't tell a lot .
But if plot , for example , some other technology , like transportation , on a <unk> curve , would be very silly , we see a straight line .
But if something happened like this , it gives you a qualitative shift .
If the technology of transport will be so fast like the microprocessors , past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
But it does n't go through that pace .
There 's no precedent in the history of technological development of growth that every few years will advance orders of magnitude .
The question I want to make is -- looking at these exponential curves , we see that they do n't follow forever .
It 's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes .
Let me give you one of two things .
Or it turns out to be a typical curve , look like this until something completely different , or maybe I 'll do something like that .
That 's all it can happen .
I 'm optimistic , so I think maybe something like this .
So now we would be in the middle of a transition .
In this line , we are in a transition from what the world used to be , to a new form .
So what I 'm trying to ask is , `` What is that new way to take the world ? ''
Where new state is going to be the world ?
The transition seems very , very confused if we 're engaged in it .
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future remains the year 2000 .
That 's all we see .
In other words , the future has shrunk , year after year , across my life .
But I think it 's because we feel something is going on .
It 's going on a transformation . We can feel it .
And we know that it does n't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that transport what we 're doing today makes no sense .
So I want to talk to you about how it might be , how that transition that we experience .
But to do that , I 'll have to talk a little bit about things that do n't have a lot to do with technology and computer .
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking away and look at things in the long term .
The scale of time in which I 'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth .
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years .
So , we go back a half a half a half million years when the Earth was a great boulder rock that <unk> around them .
If we look at the way that chemicals organized , we give a sense of how things happened .
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA , and I 'm going to tell you a simple version of this , and that is that , at that time , I had floating some droplet of oil droplet together with all sorts of chemical prescriptions inside it .
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that had been able to bring together materials from the outside and the blobs grew up .
And they started building .
In a sense , those were most primitive cell forms -- those droplet oil droplet forms .
But those blobs were not alive , in the current sense , because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals .
And every time you 've got split <unk> , the unequal distribution of chemicals they held .
So every drop was a little different .
In fact , the blobs that somehow become better at the time we bring the chemicals around , they grew more , <unk> more chemicals and divided more .
Mostly you live , they were more represented .
It was a form of life , a form of chemistry , very simple stuff , but things get interesting when these blobs learned the abstraction trick .
And in some ways that we do n't understand very well these entities learned to store information .
They learned to save information , which was the recipe for the cell , in a special chemical called DNA .
In other words , <unk> in this meaningless evolution , a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to replicate .
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have been stable since it evolved a half billion years ago .
Our recipe , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same writing system .
In fact , every single living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
And one of the things I did just for fun -- now we can write things with this code .
Here 's a hundred <unk> white dust that I 'm trying to hide to the airport security people .
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to 22 times .
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card , I have lots of them for everyone in the world , in fact , for every single person in the world and is here .
If it was a <unk> , I would have put it on a virus and would have spread out the room .
What was the next step ?
Writing the DNA was an interesting step .
This made these cells happy about another billion years .
But then another big step-by-step happened in which things became very different , and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information into these cells .
I do n't know if you know it , but bacteria can exchange DNA .
So , for example , evolved resistance to antibiotics .
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their small DNA with other bacteria , and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate .
This communication led to the communities that , in a way , they were put together in that ; and set up a synergy .
So they survived or failed together , whatever if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were shot more and they were <unk> by evolution .
And the turning point happened when these communities got so much so much as they had , in fact they came together and decided to write the whole recipe of the community together in a chain of DNA .
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years .
And at that stage , we have multicellular communities , communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism .
In fact , we are a multi-cellular community .
We have lots of cells that do n't act alone .
The skin cell does n't work without the heart , or the muscles , or the brain , etc .
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels that the cell phone , something we call an organism .
The next level that happened within these communities .
These started <unk> information .
And to build very special structures that do n't do more than processing information in community .
These are the neural structures .
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell communities built .
In fact , they began to specialize in the community as responsible structures to record , understanding and transmit information .
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
Because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism , not at the period of evolutionary time .
So an organism could , for example , learn how to eat some fruit , because he knew bad , and he got sick last time she ate it .
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had been built these information processing structures that we would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit .
And so the fact that the nervous system built these information structures dramatically accelerated the evolutionary process .
Because evolution could now become confined to an individual .
It could happen in the time you need to learn .
But then of course , individuals discovered the communication trick .
So , for example , the most refined version we know is human language .
If we think about it , it 's an amazing invention .
I have a very complicated idea of a vague idea .
I 'm here sitting in a few <unk> , and hopefully , by building a very similar , vague idea , in his head that holds some analogy with mine .
But we took something very complicated we converted into sound , in sound sequences , and we produce something very complicated in another brain .
That now allows us to start working as an organism .
In fact , as humanity , we 've started to deliver abstractions .
We now move through periods that the multicellular organisms , we abstract our design methods , presentation and information processing .
For example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
The telephony , the computer , the video tape , the CD-ROM and so on . It 's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information .
And that brings us together into something much larger , faster and able to evolve more than we did before .
Now evolution can happen at microseconds .
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which we had some evolution with the <unk> program , in front of our eyes .
And now we 've accelerated time scales again .
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years each .
The next stages , the nervous system and the brain , took about hundreds of millions of years .
The next , the next , and it took less than a million years .
And the next , like electronics , it seems to take a few decades .
The process feeds away , I suppose , is the right word to name something that speeds its own pace of change .
The more it changes , the faster it does .
And I think that 's what we looked at in this explosion of the curve .
We see the process feeds away .
But I make my life designing computers , and I know that the working mechanisms for design would n't be possible without the recent computer advances .
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional design .
I do n't know that every transistor does on that connections machine .
There are billions .
Instead , with the designers of <unk> <unk> , we think of a level of abstraction , we think of it in the machine , and the machine with that does something that they could n't , it gets much further and faster than ever before .
In fact , sometimes use methods we do n't even understand well .
A particularly interesting method , which I 've been using lately is evolution itself .
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on microseconds at microseconds .
And for example , in the most extreme cases , we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions .
We say , `` Please , please run a hundred million tests of random instructions ?
Can you just run these random instructions , running all of those programs , and take those that else that we 're going to get into what we want to do ? ''
In other words , I define what I want .
Let 's say I want to command numbers , to put a simple example .
So we find the programs that are more often coming into numbers .
Of course , it 's unlikely for some random sequences of instructions , <unk> numbers , so none of them did it .
But one , luckily , could find two numbers in the right order .
And I said , `` computer , could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that you 'd better do the task ? ''
<unk> those and <unk> the rest of them .
And now I <unk> the ones that better ordered the numbers .
And let 's go back to <unk> following a recombination from analogous to sex . ''
So let 's take two programs , that you will <unk> children , which will <unk> <unk> , and that the kids will make the properties of both programs .
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little more success generation .
And we say , `` Please repeat the process . ''
<unk> again .
They were going to look at some mutations .
And it 's trying to bring it back to another generation .
Well , every generation takes a few milliseconds .
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or , in complicated cases , in a few hours .
In the end , we ended up with programs that are gaining absolutely perfect ways .
In fact , they 're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand .
If I look at those programs I ca n't tell you how they work .
I 've tried to analyze them to see how they work .
These are dark programs , strangers .
But they actually do .
In fact , I know , I have the safety that we get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it .
In fact , their lives are dependent on that .
Once I was going on a 747 with thumb for me , and he puts out a card and says , `` Look at this .
He says , `` <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a safe flight . Does n't you feel quiet ? ''
We know that engineering processes do n't work very well when they get complicated .
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes .
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering .
However , we do n't understand the whole options we have .
In that sense , it goes in front of us .
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster , and so we can run these programs much faster .
So it feeds out .
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk> .
Because all of these technologies are fed down .
We 're taking off .
And we 're at a moment analog to the single-celled organisms when they got multicellular .
We are the amoebas and we ca n't understand what the hell we 're creating .
We 're at the turning point .
But I think something comes behind us .
I think it would be very arrogant of our part , to think that we are the final product of evolution .
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come .
But now it comes lunch , and I think I 'm going to stop here before I get stuck .
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change .
And I think this starts with a doctor , and that 's me .
And I spent long enough to allow me to give me some of my fake prestige in that .
Before I treat the theme of my talk , let 's talk a little baseball .
Why not ?
We 're near the end , the World Series .
We love baseball , right ?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics .
There are hundreds of statistics .
It 's because of the rules of the rules , and we 're talking about statistics , and we 're going to use them to form a great baseball team .
I 'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you are familiar with you .
It 's called average <unk> .
And we 're talking about 300 , a <unk> that <unk> 300 .
That means <unk> <unk> , three of 10 times .
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being stuck , and that anyone who 's trying to throw it at the first base , not to get it at time , and the second base will be saved .
It 's three attempts at 10 attempts .
You know how they call a <unk> in the Grand <unk> ?
Well , really good , maybe the team of stars .
You know how they call a <unk> baseball ?
By the way , that 's someone who is 10 strokes , it 's got four .
<unk> -- like <unk> Williams , the last player at the League Major <unk> <unk> <unk> on a regular season .
Now I 'm going to show this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable , or maybe less uncomfortable , after what I 'm going to tell you about today .
Suppose you have appendicitis , and they are derivatives to a surgeon that has also a <unk> record .
It does n't work , right ?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and one loved one has two clogged coronary arteries , and their family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record is 200 .
But you know something ?
She 's actually improving this year .
And the hits you have been <unk> .
This is not working .
But I 'm going to ask you .
What do you think that it should be the average of the hits of a cardiac surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon , or a nurse or a <unk> <unk> ?
1,000 , very well .
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon , from a doctor or a medical care .
What we do , however , is sent to the world , and I included , with the mandate of being perfect .
That never , ever , make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right .
That was the message that I was doing when I was in medical school .
I was a <unk> student .
Once , a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman said to a blood test .
Like that .
<unk> in my little <unk> , in the <unk> house at General Toronto , not far away from here .
And I learned all of the memory .
From my kind of anatomy , I memorized the origin and muscle work , the branching out of every artery that comes out of the <unk> , <unk> differential and not usual .
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the kidney <unk> <unk> .
And as much as much more knowledge and more knowledge .
And I was going very well ; I graduated with <unk> .
And I <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you 're going to take everything , then it would know everything , or as possible , close to everything , because I get rid of the mistakes .
And it worked for a while , until I met the lady <unk> .
I was a resident in college in college here , in Toronto , when they brought the lady in the emergency service , where I was working .
At that time , I was assigned to a cardiology service .
And when I emergency my cardiologist on a cardiologist , he touched that patient .
And to inform the chief of residents .
When I saw the lady <unk> , I was very excited .
I heard a <unk> sound .
And when the <unk> , I heard a <unk> sound on both sides , which was explaining to me a congestive heart failure .
In these conditions , the heart stops working , instead of pump the blood forward , the blood goes into the lungs , and so there 's a little bit of blood breathing .
And it was n't hard to diagnose .
I did it , and I started working on the treatment that would give him .
I gave him aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure on its heart .
I gave him <unk> , water pills , so that I could eliminate liquid .
And in an hour or two , she started feeling better .
And I sat very well .
And that was when I made the first mistake -- he sent him home .
I actually made two mistakes more .
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents .
I did n't get up the phone , and I did what I should have done , which was to call my boss and <unk> him with him to see her .
And if my boss would have seen it , I would have been able to bring tools .
Maybe I did it for a good reason .
Maybe I did n't want to be a resident to <unk> constant attention .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility , that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss .
The second mistake I made was worse .
When they send it to their house , he did n't take attention to a voice in my interior , which was saying , `` Sachs , it 's not a good idea . Do n't do it . ''
In fact , he was so insecure that he was taking care of the woman who was taking care of the lady <unk> , `` Do you think it 's okay if you go home ? ''
And the nurse thought , and then he said very naturally , `` Yes , I think I 'm okay . ''
I remember that as if it was yesterday .
So he was signed up the high , and the ambulance along with the E.R . took her home .
And I went back to the hospital room .
The rest of that day , that afternoon , I had a bad feeling in the stomach .
But I went on with my job .
At the end of the day , I packed to leaving the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home , and I did something I do n't normally do .
It went through the emergency room service .
And there 's another nurse there , not the one who was taking care of the lady <unk> before , but another one . He told me three words , those three words that most emergency doctors fear .
Other specialists are afraid of it as well , but there 's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see the <unk> patients .
The three words are : Do you remember .
`` Do you remember the patient who sent home ? ''
He asked the other <unk> nurse .
`` Well she came back , '' with the same tone of voice .
She was fine .
But I came back and on the edge of death .
Instead of an hour from having come home , after I gave her the high , he suffered a collapse and his family called 911 , and his family brought emergency with a blood pressure pressure of <unk> , which means a shock severe .
I barely breathe and I was blue .
The emergency staff go through all their resources .
They gave medication to raise blood pressure .
And they put a ventilator .
I was shocked and <unk> to the spinal cord .
He had a mixture of feelings , because after the <unk> was in intensive care , and hoping for all hope he would recover .
And in the two or three days , it was clear that we never <unk> .
He had permanent brain damage .
The family gathered together .
And in eight or nine days , it was <unk> to what was happening .
And at the ninth day , he stopped him . The lady <unk> , wife , mother and grandmother .
They say they never forget the names of dying .
That was my first experience .
The next couple of weeks , I was getting excited about it and I experienced for the first time the embarrassment of shame , and I felt just , isolated , without feeling that healthy shame because you ca n't get rid of your colleagues .
You make peace and never make that mistake .
It 's that shame that leaves a teaching .
<unk> shame I 'm talking about is the one that makes us feel very badly .
It 's the one that tells us what we did was wrong , but we 're bad .
And that felt .
And it was n't by my boss ; he was a charm .
I talked to the family , and I 'm sure I 'm sure I 'm going to make sure that I did n't get stuck .
And I kept getting those questions .
Why did n't I ask my boss ? Why was he sent to her house ?
And in my worst moments , why made I made a stupid mistake ?
Why did I choose medicine ?
Little by that feeling was <unk> .
And I began to feel better .
And on a cloudy day , the sky opened and finally came up , and I wondered if I would feel better again .
And I made a deal with me where if you were to raise the efforts to be perfect for not more mistakes , I would pause those voices .
And so it was .
I went back to work .
But it came back .
Two years later , I was an assistant on the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto , and I got a man from 25 years old with a pain in his throat .
I was very busy and in a hurry .
And he pointed out here .
I looked to her throat , and I looked at her throat .
He sent him penicillin , and he sent him home .
But while he ran to the door , he kept pointing out his throat .
Two days later , when I came to make my head shift , my boss asked to talk to me , I 'm going to talk to me in his office .
And I gave three words : Do you remember .
Do you remember the patient who saw for a pain in your throat ?
Well he came back and did n't have a <unk> <unk> .
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk> .
You can look for Google . It 's an infection , not from your throat , but it 's about the top air , and that can cause the closing of those tracks .
He , fortunately , did n't die .
You would get antibiotics out of it , and you get recovered and recovered .
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> , then I was struck , and I came back to work , until over and over again and again .
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn , not vessels .
And it 's a great effort , especially working in a hospital , because they are assisted at 14 patients at the same time .
But in both cases , I was n't sent home , and I do n't think it was a carelessness .
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation .
Order an X-ray of kidneys , but it turned out , a colleague that I was checking on the patient perceived to perceived in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon .
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea .
I read liquid order to <unk> , and I asked my colleague to <unk> it .
I checked , and when I saw certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner , I called the surgeon .
Both were operated and recovered .
But every case I was <unk> , I <unk> .
But I 'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise , and as many colleagues say , it 's a mess .
The most meaningful have been over the last five years .
Only , ashamed and <unk> .
And here 's the problem : If I ca n't release me and talk about my mistakes , if I ca n't find the little voice to tell me what happens , how could I share this with my colleagues ?
How do I teach them that they do n't make the same mistakes ?
If I would go into a place like this , I would have no idea what you think about me .
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure , after failure , after failure ?
Of course , in a party , you 'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors , but you do n't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
And if I knew , and my colleagues also , that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg , believe me I 'd have a hard time looking at it .
This is the system we have .
<unk> denial .
It 's the system where there are two positions : those who make mistakes and those who do n't sleep , and those who do n't sleep , and the ones who have the bad things , and those who have great results .
And it 's almost like a ideological reaction , like antibodies that start to attack that person .
We have the idea that if we step back in medicine to people who make mistakes , we 'll get a safe system .
But that brings two problems .
In 20 years , about diffusion of medical malpractice and medical errors , I 've done a <unk> of bad medical malpractice and medical errors to learn as possible , from the first article I wrote for the Toronto , `` White <unk> , Black Art . ''
And what I learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous .
We worked in a system where mistakes happen every day , where one in 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong , or <unk> is not right . In a system where hospital-acquired infections are increasingly , and more numerous , causing chaos and death .
In this country , 24,000 Canadian was killed by preventable medical errors .
The U.S. Medicine Institute established 100,000 .
In both cases , it 's about <unk> <unk> , because we 're not <unk> the problem as we should .
And so there are things .
A hospitable system where knowledge is added up every two or three years , and we do n't <unk> us .
Sleep deprivation is filled with everything .
And we ca n't get rid of it .
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain .
Now , let 's take the same patient with a chest pain , it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes and <unk> to alcohol , and all of a sudden , my story <unk> from contempt .
It 's not the same story .
I 'm not a robot ; I do n't do things like that .
And my patients are not cars . They did n't ignore their symptoms forever .
All of this , errors are inevitable .
So if we take the system as they were taught , and we eliminate all the professional professionals to mistake , well , we wo n't get anybody .
And about it that people do n't want to talk about their most serious cases ?
In my program : `` <unk> white , black art , '' it 's already a custom to say , `` This is my worst mistake . '' I would say to everybody , from the ambulance to the head of cardiac surgery : `` This is my worst mistake , '' blah , blah , blah -- `` What are your mistakes ? '' And I 'll tell you
And his students were <unk> , <unk> , to go down the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories .
They want to tell their stories , they want to share them .
<unk> power to say , `` Look , it does n't make the same mistake . ''
They need a context where we can do that .
They need a <unk> medical culture .
And it starts with a doctor every time .
The medical physician is human , he accepts it , accepts , and he is not proud of their mistakes , but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others .
It shares their experiences with them .
It 's support for those who talk about their mistakes .
Points out the mistakes of other people , not with the intention of reaching them , but a loving way that they all benefit from .
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system , and when this happens , they make mistakes occasionally .
My name is Brian Sachs .
I 'm a medical physician .
I 'm human , make mistakes .
And I 'm very sorry , but I 'm trying to learn something that can convey to others .
I do n't know what you think about me , but I can live with that .
And let me close with three personal words : I remember it .
Do you know how many decisions we take one day ?
Do you know how much choosing it in a week ?
I recently made a survey for over 2,000 people , and the average amount of choices that he says to pick an American , it 's about 70 to a day .
Not long ago , in research , they followed for a week to a group of companies .
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks , by these executives , and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks .
They found that , on average , <unk> <unk> jobs for week .
Naturally , every work included lots of <unk> .
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less .
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time .
Now think of your choices .
Do you know how many people belong to the nine minutes , and how many of an hour ?
How do you figure out how to make those decisions ?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems today : choose to the <unk> of choice .
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
As I talk about this , I 'm going to ask you a few questions , and I need to know your answers .
When I ask a question , like I 'm blind , raise your hand only if you want to burn calories .
Otherwise , when I ask a question , if your response is positive please please take a <unk> .
And now my first question of the day : Are you ready to hear about the <unk> problem .
Thank you .
Being a graduate student at Stanford University , <unk> this very , very high level supermarket -- at least at the time it was very sophisticated .
It was called <unk> .
It was almost like going to an amusement park .
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar , over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of bottled water , and this was when we made water from the faucet .
I loved going to the store , but I was at one occasion , why do I never buy anything ?
This is the olive oil shelf .
They had over 75 different classes , including the ones that were in sealed box that came from millennials .
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her , `` It works well this strategy of providing all of these options ? ''
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day , usually with their cameras .
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> . This is the <unk> .
<unk> .
They had <unk> different classes .
<unk> a post for <unk> , right to the store .
We put up there with six flavors , or out of 24 different flavors , and we looked at two things : First , what would people have been willing to stop testing the jelly ?
More people stopped when there were 24 , 60 percent , that when there was only six , 40 percent .
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jelly pot .
Here 's the opposite effect .
From those who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent came to buy jelly .
From those standing when there was six , we saw 30 percent bought jelly .
If you do the calculations , people had six times more likely to buy jelly if they found six , if they found out 24 .
Well , to decide that we do n't buy jelly crops , it 's less good to keep the <unk> , but it turns out that the problem of choices overload are affecting us in momentous decisions .
We decided to do n't decide , even when this is not <unk> .
Now the theme of the day : financial savings .
I 'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , where we look at savings decisions for retirement , from about a million Americans , from about 650 plans from this country .
We were interested in looking at whether the number of funding for funding for retirement plans , 401 program , <unk> people to save for the future .
And we found that there really was a correlation .
We had <unk> plans from two to 59 different options .
We found that the bigger the number of funding was offered , there were fewer participation .
So if we look at the extremes , we see that in the plans that offer two funds , the rate of participation was 70 percent or more , not as high as they would like .
And in the plans that were offered about 60 funds , the population rate went down to the 60 60 .
It turns out that even if you decide to participate , when there are more choices , even in that case , there are negative consequences .
So , for those who decided to participate , the bigger the number of choices , more people will be used to avoid stocks or investment funds .
As far as there were more choices , they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts .
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize future financial well-being .
In the previous decade , we 've seen three major negative negative consequences by giving them more and more possibilities .
The most likely thing is that we make the decision , which is still when it goes against self-interest .
They 're more likely to make the worst decisions -- in finance and health .
They 're more likely to pick things less satisfying , albeit objectively going to go better .
The main reason is that we enjoy looking at that giant variety of <unk> , mustard and vinegar and jelly , but we 're not able to do the math to compare , contrast and choose from that amazing display .
Today I want to propose to you about four simple techniques that we 've tried , in a way or other research , so that they can rehearse in their business .
The first is , <unk> .
You 've already heard it before , but it has never been more true than today , which is less .
People are always upset when I say , `` <unk> . ''
They care about losing space in the <unk> .
But actually what we 're seeing is increasingly that if you choose to cut , getting rid of strange redundant options , there will be an increase in sales , <unk> costs , there will be a better experience in choice .
When <unk> & Gamble went from 26 different <unk> , I went from 26 different <unk> and <unk> 15 , saw an increase in 10 percent .
When the unseen Cat Cat eliminated the products for <unk> cats that are less being sold , they increased their profit at 87 percent , by two causes : bigger sales and lower costs .
You know , the supermarkets today , on average , offer 45 products .
In a Walmart store of Walmart , there are about 100,000 products .
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and offers only 1,400 products ; a kind of tomato sauce .
In the financial savings world , I think that one of the best examples that have come up with how to handle better choices is the <unk> of David <unk> , the Harvard program .
All the employees in Harvard are automatically <unk> to a insurance fund .
Who really wants to choose , they 're offered 20 money , not 300 or more .
You know , people often say , `` I do n't know how to cut .
They 're all important options . ''
The first thing I do is ask employees : `` Tell me the differences that are between those options .
And if your employees ca n't tell the difference , you ca n't make your customers do it . ''
This afternoon , before I started this session , I was talking to Gary .
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience a vacation with all paid the most beautiful highway in the world .
Here , a description .
I want you to read it .
I 'm going to leave a few seconds to read and then I want you to give them a round of applause , if you 're ready to take the supply of Gary .
Okay . Anyone who 's ready to accept supply .
Are they not more ?
Well , I 'm going to show you something else .
You knew that there was a trick .
Who is ready for that journey ?
I think I really heard more hands .
All right .
Actually , you had more information on the first round , which in the second one , but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real .
Because the images made it look more real .
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of options , which is <unk> .
For people to understand the differences between choices , they have to understand the consequences of each choice , and that the consequences must be feeling very vivid , very concrete .
Why should people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average , when they use debit cards or credit cards , which when they use cash ?
Because it does n't look real money .
It turns out that it looks more real , it can be a very positive tool for people to save more .
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , about <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> -- these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a 401 plan .
That meeting , that we just save exactly the way we used , we made a little addition .
What we add was that we appeal to the staff to think about the positive things that were going to think about their lives if they were saving more money .
With this <unk> , there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in how much they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts , four percent .
The third technique is <unk> .
We can handle more categories of choice .
For example , this is a study we did in a magazine hall .
We saw that in the supermarkets <unk> 's over the northeast row , the exhibition exhibition can contain since 46 different types to <unk> .
But , you know ?
Because the classification tells me how to distinguish them .
These are two pieces of jewelry .
One is called `` <unk> '' and the other , `` <unk> . ''
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> , and the one on the right is <unk> , <unk> .
Very few applause . Okay , there are some .
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> , and the one on the right is <unk> , <unk> .
Well , something else .
It turns out it 's right .
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> . But you know something ?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless .
<unk> need to indicate something you choose , not what defines them .
You often see this problem with those huge <unk> .
Who are I reporting ?
My fourth category : <unk> complexity .
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think about , if we just simplified it a little bit .
We need to increase complexity gradually .
I 'm going to show you an example of what I mean .
Let 's make a little complicated decision ; the purchase of a car .
This is a German gun manufacturer that allows you to completely miss .
You have to take 60 decisions , to build your car .
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one .
<unk> , outer color in the car . I 'm 56 possibilities .
Motor Company , <unk> box ; four choices .
What I 'm going to do is vary the order in which decisions are made .
So the half of the customers are going to go from many choices , 56 colors , a few , four boxes .
The other half of the customers are going to go through a few options , four boxes , <unk> colors , lots of options .
And what am I going to look at ?
So what you are .
If you beat up the default button in every decision , this indicates that you 're overwhelmed , or you 're losing them .
We found that those who are going to be a lot of choices to very few , put the default button over and over again and another .
We lose them .
If you go from a few choices to many , you go on there .
The same information , the same number of choices .
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information is presented .
If you start with how easy , you learn to choose .
Even though I pick the box of change , I do n't mean anything about the preferences of the decoration decoration , in all ways we make a choice .
We 're excited about a product that we 're building that now has more engaged in the process .
Just to sum up .
Now , I 've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of choice : <unk> , eliminate strange alternatives ; <unk> , to make it real ; we can handle , we can manage more categories of less choices ; we can measure complexity .
All of these techniques I 've presented were designed to help manage alternatives , or better , for you , to use them in their issues , or for people who serve .
It 's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful when I choose .
And the more careful being done in our best choices , we can practice the art of choice .
Thank you very much .
In the 1980s , in a communist East Germany , if you had a typewriter typewriter , I had to get it to the government .
I had to register a piece of text from a written example with the machine .
And this is why the government could track the origin of texts .
If they found an written message with the wrong message , they could track the footprint into the origin of the idea .
In the West , we do n't conceive of that someone could do this , how much this is going to make freedom of speech freedom .
We would never do that in our countries .
But today , in 2011 , if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print a page , you end up having some little yellow printed dots on each page , and you follow a pattern that makes you from one and your printer .
That 's what 's happening today .
And nobody seems to make a lot of this .
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us , citizens .
And it 's one of the three main causes of problems on the network .
If we see what happens in the world online , we can put together the attacks of their attackers .
There are three main groups .
There 's the cybercriminals .
Like Mr. Dimitry <unk> from the city from Kiev , in Ukraine .
The cybercriminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use cyberattacks for a lot of money , huge amounts .
There are really many cases of millionaires online , billionaires who would make money with their attacks .
This is Vladimir <unk> , of <unk> , Estonia .
This is Alfred <unk> .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is <unk> <unk> .
These are Matthew Anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortunes online , but they do illegal means without banking , to steal from our bills , when we buy online , or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a infected computer .
The secret to the United States , two months ago , froze the Swiss account of this guy , Sam Jain , and this one has <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
Mr. Jain , Mr. Jain , they do n't know .
And I say today is more likely than any of us who are victim to be victim of a real crime .
And it 's very obvious that this is wrong with worse .
In the future , most crimes are online .
The second group of attackers in importance that we 're looking at today is not motivated by money .
There 's another thing that moves , they motivate them the protests , motivate them to tell them the laughter .
groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months , occupying a prominent role in online attacks .
Those are the three main attackers : criminals who make it for money , <unk> like Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are national states , the governments that attack .
And then we see cases like <unk> .
That 's a good example of government attack against its own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> authority from the Netherlands , or actually it was .
<unk> the last fall , because of a <unk> .
<unk> the safety of the site and sacrificed a <unk> .
I asked last week , in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives , asked one of the leaders if they were getting to get the death of people in the heart attack .
And the answer to him was yes .
So how do people die in a heart attack ?
<unk> is an <unk> authority .
<unk> .
What serve the certificates ?
Well , you need if you have a website with <unk> , services , <unk> <unk> , services like Gmail .
Except for a foreign authority .
And that was emitting <unk> certificates .
And in the case of <unk> , exactly that .
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened , for example , in Egypt ?
Well , in Egypt , the protesters they were they looted out the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police , in April 2011 , and during looting , they found a lot of papers .
There was this folder called `` <unk> . ''
And within that folder , there was a <unk> of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country .
I 'd sold this tool for 280 euros the Egyptian government .
The company headquarters is right here .
I mean , Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens .
But Western governments also do this themselves .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago , I found <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens .
If you 're suspicious , in a good criminal case , it 's pretty obvious that your phone is intervened .
But today it goes beyond .
It <unk> the Internet connection .
We have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication , and listen to the discussion online , to get our data .
When we think about things like this the obvious answer should be , `` Well , it looks something wrong , but it does n't really affect me because I 'm a honest citizen .
Why worry ?
I have nothing to hide . ''
And that argument does n't make sense .
It 's about privacy .
Privacy is not arguing .
It 's not a question of privacy against security .
It 's about freedom against control .
If you could trust our governments today in 2011 , any right that we 're going to do today , it will be forever .
Are we blindly blind in any future government , in a administration that we could have within 50 years ?
These are the questions that are worried about the next 50 years .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , in the southern part of Nairobi .
These are the cows of my dad , at the bottom , and behind the cows , the National Park of Nairobi .
The National Park of Nairobi does n't have fences most of the South , which means that wild animals like zebras are freely migrate outside the park .
And predators , like lions , follow , and this is what they do .
<unk> our livestock .
This is one of the ones that killed the night , and so soon we got up in the morning , and we found it dead , because it was the only one one that we had .
My community , the <unk> , we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> , and so we value them so much .
So I grew up hate the lions .
The people were dying of our community and the livestock , and they 're also upset with the problem .
So kill lions .
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi .
I think that 's because there are so few in the National Park of Nairobi .
A child in my community , from six to nine years old , is responsible for the livestock of his father , and this was the same thing that was happening to me .
So I had to find a way to solve this problem .
My first idea was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared .
But I realized that actually this did n't help , because even I was helping the lions to see the shed away .
I did n't give up . He went on .
A second idea was to use a <unk> .
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was close to the pen .
But lions are very smart . They came the first day and they saw the <unk> , and they were , but the second day , they came back and said , `` This thing does n't move , it 's always here . So went and killed animals .
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch , and that day the lions came .
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves .
So I had an idea .
And I got a switch on to turn on and off the lights .
And this is a little lamp from a broken leg .
<unk> everything .
As you can see , the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little <unk> box . I call it a transformative .
And the <unk> box makes it <unk> .
As you can see , they <unk> them out , because that 's where lions come from .
And this is how lions do when they come from night .
<unk> lights and <unk> lions to think that I 'm walking through the pen , but I 'm sitting in my bed .
Thank you .
So I put them in my house two years ago , and since then , we never had a problem with lions .
And you heard the neighborhood , you heard the idea .
One of them is from this grandmother .
She had killed a lot of animals killed the lions and asked me if I could put the lights on .
I said yes .
I put them . You can see the bottom , these are the lights for lions .
Since then , I 've installed them in seven houses in my community , and they 're serving a lot .
And my idea is also used by all Kenya , to scare other predators as hyena , leopards , and also is used to scare elephants from the farms .
Thanks to this invention , I was fortunate to get a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya , <unk> International School , and I 'm very excited .
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk> .
It even took my friends to my community , and we installed lights in the houses that do n't have them , and I show them how to put them .
So a year ago , I was just a child on the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father , and I used to see planes flying , and it said that one day it would be within one .
And here I am .
I got the opportunity to come on the plane for the first time to TED .
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when it grows .
I used to hate lions , but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and lions , we can be with lions without any conflict .
<unk> <unk> . What in my tongue means , thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : You do n't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you .
So you get a scholarship . Richard <unk> : Yeah .
CA : You 're working on other electric inventions .
What 's the next one on your list ?
<unk> : My next invention is -- I want to make an electric fence . CA : An <unk> fence ?
<unk> : I know that the electric fences are invented , but I want to make mine .
CA : You know , you 've got it once , right ? , and you -- <unk> : I 've tried before , but I stopped because I got a <unk> . CA : At the foot of the canyon , Richard <unk> , you 're something big .
We 're going to take it into every step you take , my friend .
Thank you very much . <unk> : Thank you very much .
When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet .
And I grew up singing a song called `` <unk> nothing . ''
And I felt very proud .
In school , we passed all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> 's story , but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world , except that America , South Korea , are the enemies .
I thought sometimes about the rest of the world , I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea , until everything changed suddenly .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor and I had never gone hungry .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from my sister 's colleague .
It said , `` When I 'm going to <unk> this , the five family members will stop there in this world , because we have n't eaten in the two weeks .
We 're <unk> together on the floor , and our bodies are so weak , we 're prepared to die . ''
He was very altered .
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country .
When I was walking in front of the train station , I saw something terrible I ca n't erase from my memory .
A woman without life was dead on the street , holding a kid in her arms , watching her mother 's face without being able to do anything .
No one was helping them , because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families .
A huge famine would stop North Korea in the middle of the '90s .
In the end , over a million North Koreans died during the famine , and only just a few survived eating grass , insects and tree cortex .
They also became more and more prevalent the <unk> of energy , all around me , completely in the dark , except for the sea lights in China , barely crossing the river from my house .
I always wondered why they had light and us not .
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries .
This is the <unk> River , which serves the limit between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Koreans in secretly .
But many people die .
Sometimes , I see bodies floating around the river .
I ca n't reveal the details of how I left North Korea , but I can only say that during the years of the famine , I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
But I just thought I 'd be separated from my family for short time .
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard to live as a young woman without my family .
I had no idea what life is like a refugee 's refugee .
But soon I learned that it 's not just extremely difficult , but dangerous , because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal immigrants .
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed , and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea .
One day , my worst nightmare became true , when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was getting stuck in the police station .
Someone had been accused of being <unk> , then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked a lot of questions .
I was <unk> .
I thought my heart was going to explode .
If it did n't seem natural , it could be incarcerated and <unk> .
I thought my life was going to end .
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions .
At the end of the interrogation , an official told another , `` This was a false report . She 's not <unk> . ''
And they let me go . It was a miracle .
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies .
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese and deported police .
These women were very lucky .
Even though they had caught them , they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure .
These North Koreans were not so lucky .
Every year , countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> across North Korea , where they are tortured , imprisoned or executed in public .
Although I was lucky to escape , many other North Koreans have n't been so lucky .
It 's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive .
Even after learning a new language and finding work , all of the world can be able to get it in a moment .
That 's why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea .
and I started a new life again .
<unk> in South Korea was a much higher challenge than I expected .
The English was very important in South Korea , I had to start learning my third language .
Also , I understood that there was a big gap between North and South .
We are all Koreans , but inside , we 've come to be very different because of 67 years of division .
Even through an identity crisis .
Am I <unk> or <unk> ?
Where am I ? Who am I ?
Suddenly , there was no country I could call myself pride .
Even though we 're going to live in South Korea , it was n't easy , I made a plan . I started studying for the income exam at the University .
Just when I started <unk> to my new life , I got an alarming call .
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money sent to my family , and , as punishment , my family was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location outside .
They had to run away from immediately .
So I started planning how to help them escape .
North Koreans have to travel long distances along the way to freedom .
It 's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea .
So , ironically , I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea .
Since my family could n't speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , over 3,000 miles across China and then across Asia .
The journey in <unk> took a week , and we were still trapped in several times .
Once our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer .
He asked all of it . And he started asking questions .
As my family could n't understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
When the Chinese officer came to my family , I stood up and I told her , they were <unk> people who were accompanying it .
And I looked at me , but I was fortunately luckily .
We did all the way up to the <unk> border .
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border border in <unk> .
But even after spending the border , my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border .
After paying tickets and bribes , my family was released in a month .
But at the time , my family was arrested and incarcerated over again in the <unk> capital .
This was one of the lowest points in my life .
I did everything to liberate my family , and we were so close , but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the embassy of South Korea .
I was going and I was coming in between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to release my family .
But I did n't have enough money to pay more bribes or tickets .
I lost the hope .
At that point , or the voice of a man , `` What 's the problem ? ''
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask .
With my poor English and a dictionary , I explained to her , and without doubt , the man went to the ATM , and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and the other two Koreans and to take them out of prison .
I thank you with all my heart , and I asked her , `` Why do I help me ? ''
`` I 'm not helping you , '' he said .
I 'm helping the <unk> town . ''
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life .
The kind of unknown <unk> will be a new hope for me and to the village , when we needed it .
And it showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the <unk> of hope that the <unk> people need .
Over time , after our long journey , my family and I sat down in South Korea .
But achieving your freedom is only half the battle .
Many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they <unk> a new country , they start with a little bit of money .
So we can benefit from the international community with education , English language practices , work practice , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world .
Because a lot of us continue to contact with family still in , we send information and money that 's helping to change North Korea from the inside .
I 've been fortunate , I 've gotten a lot of help and inspired in my life , so I want to help rise North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support .
I 'm sure you 're going to see more and more North Koreans , <unk> around the world , including on the TED stage .
Thank you .
I live in South Center .
This is South Center : <unk> stores , fast food , <unk> land .
So the city planners came together and they thought , we 're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else , so they changed it to South L.A. , as if this is what it 's actually wrong in the city .
This is South L.A. . <unk> <unk> , fast food , <unk> land .
Just as it took millions of other Americans , I live in a food desert , Los Angeles , home for the places of food to bring and to eat in the car .
The curious thing is that places of food to get killed more people than food in the car .
People are dying of treatable illnesses in the South Central Center .
For example , the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than , say , Beverly Hills , which is about 15 miles away .
I emphasize that this happens .
And I wonder , how do you feel if you did n't have access to healthy food , and if every time you go out of your house , you see the bad effects that the current food system has in your neighborhood ?
I see chairs from wheels bought and sold as a car .
I see <unk> centers like Starbucks .
And I think this must stop .
I think the problem is the solution .
The food is the problem , and it 's the solution .
And I 've also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and forth to buy an apple that does n't have pesticides .
What I did , it was planting a food forest in front of my house .
In a band of land that we call a gardening .
It 's 45 feet x 3 .
The point is , that belongs to the city .
But you have to keep it .
I said , `` Well , I can do what comes to me in wins , because it 's my responsibility and I have to keep it . ''
That 's how I decided to keep it .
So my group and me , L.A. Green <unk> , we put us together and we started planting our food forest , <unk> trees , you know , the nine full vegetables .
What we do , we are a kind of <unk> group in advance of gardeners of all the backgrounds , all the whole city and completely voluntary , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it was beautiful .
And then somebody complained .
The city was done on me , and it was given me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden , the <unk> was made by order .
And I said , `` Come on , really ?
A warrant in order to plant food in a piece of land that nobody cares ? '' So it was like , `` Well , <unk> . ''
Because this time it was n't going to happen .
The L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> , and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> , who put a request in Change.org , with 900 firms , we were a success .
We had the victory in our hands .
My <unk> even called to say they supported and loved what we were doing .
I mean , let 's say , why is n't it ?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk> land .
It 's 68 miles of <unk> land .
That 's equivalent to 20 Central Parks .
That 's enough space to plant <unk> million tomato plants .
Why on earth does n't it look like this ?
<unk> a plant for a thousand , 10,000 seeds .
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result .
It 's my hymn , when I tell people , you grow your own food .
<unk> your own food is how you print your own money .
You see , I have a legacy of South <unk> .
And I grew up there . I went to my kids there .
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others , and I 'm going to actually manufacture my own reality .
You see , I 'm an artist .
<unk> is my graffiti , I develop my art .
Such a graffiti artist , <unk> walls , I <unk> soils , <unk> .
I use the garden , the land , like a piece of canvas , and plants and trees are my <unk> of that canvas .
You 'd be surprised to see what Earth can do . If you let it be their canvas .
You just ca n't imagine how amazing it is , and how it affects people .
What happened ?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education , of my neighborhood transformation .
To change the community , you have to change the composition of the land .
We are the land .
You 'd be surprised to see how kids are affecting you .
<unk> is the most therapeutic and provocative act that you can do , especially in a <unk> .
Also , they get strawberries .
I remember one occasion , which was a mother and her daughter , were like the 10:30 <unk> , and they were in my garden , salt and looked very <unk> .
I , well , man , I felt bad to be there , and I said , you know , you do n't have to do this .
This is on the street for a reason .
I felt embarrassed by looking at people who were so close to me with hunger , and this just reinforces why I do this , people ask me , `` End , do n't temes that people will steal your food ? ''
I say , `` Oh God no , I 'm not afraid you 're going to steal . ''
That 's what it is on the street .
That 's what it is about .
I want you to take it , but at your time , I want you to raise your health . ''
There was another time that I put a garden in a shelter in a <unk> shelter in downtown Los Angeles .
They were these guys , who helped me to download the truck .
It was fabulous , and they shared their stories about how this was affected , and how they used to plant with her mom and grandmother , and it was fabulous to see how this changed it , so just for a moment .
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 gardens .
We 've had , like about 50 people coming , work and participate , all in voluntary plan .
If kids get <unk> , kids will eat <unk> .
If you grow tomatoes , you 'll eat tomatoes , but if you do n't teach them how food affects your mind and your body , you eat blind people to put them in front of them .
I see young people who want to work , but they have this thing where they 're trapped , and I see color kids who are on this path designed for them , which does n't take them anywhere .
With gardening , I see a chance in which we can train these kids who are <unk> out of their communities to have a sustainable life .
And when we do this , who knows ?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk> .
But if we do n't change the composition of the land , we 'll never do it .
Now this is one of my plans . This is something I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gardens , where people can share food on the same block .
I want to bring in containers and turn them into healthy coffee .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about free stuff , because it 's not sustainable .
What 's curious about sustainability , is you have to <unk> .
What I 'm talking about is to get people to work , getting the kids out of the street , who know the joy , the pride and the honor of growing their own food , opening farmers ' markets .
What I want to do here , we have to make it sexy .
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> , <unk> , gardeners <unk> .
We have to change the script of what a <unk> is .
If you 're not a gardener , you 're not a <unk> .
What the <unk> will take their <unk> ?
That 's the weapon of choice .
In addition , if you want to meet with me , well , if you want to see me , I 'm not going to call me in my comfortable chairs and having meetings to talk about doing some crap -- to talk about doing some crap .
If you want to see me , you come to the garden with your backhoe , so we can plant something .
Peace : Thank you .
Thank you .
( <unk> noise ) You probably all agree with me that this is a pretty nice road .
It 's built on asphalt , and asphalt is a good material to drive , but it does n't always , especially not in days as today , it rain a lot .
You can have a lot of water on asphalt that makes a splash .
And especially if you 're riding on your bicycle and these cars pass , that 's not very nice .
Also , asphalt can make a lot of noise .
It 's a noisy material , and if we build roads , like in the Netherlands , very close to cities , we would want a quiet road .
The solution for that is to make <unk> roads .
The porous pavement , a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands , has pores and water can flow through it , so the entire water water flows toward the sides and will have a road that 's easy to drive , and it 's not going to make water anymore .
Noise also disappear in these pores .
Because it 's very open , all the noise goes away , so it 's a very quiet road .
It also has disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that you can undo .
What is to get rid of ? See , on this road , the stones on the surface are coming out .
First of a rock , then several more and more and more and so on , and then -- well , I 'm not going to do that , but you can harm your windshield and you 're not happy with that .
And finally , this can also bring more and more damage .
Sometimes you can create bumps with that .
Ah . It 's ready .
<unk> , of course , can be converted into a problem , but we have a solution .
Here you can actually see what the damage appears in this material .
It 's <unk> asphalt , as I said , so it only has a little amount of <unk> between the stones .
Because of the <unk> , to the ultraviolet light , to the <unk> , this <unk> , this <unk> , the glue between the <unk> , it 's <unk> , and if you <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> and you will separate from the <unk> .
So if you drive around the road , you 'll get the <unk> -- you know , we 've seen it here .
To solve this problem , we think of <unk> materials .
If we can make this material <unk> , then we probably have a solution .
So what we can do is we can use steel wool from that to clean <unk> , and we can cut <unk> steel wool into very small chunks , and we can mix these little pieces with the <unk> .
So , we have asphalt with small pieces of steel wool in it .
Then you need a machine , like that you see here , you use to cook -- a induction machine .
<unk> can heat up , especially steel is very good at that .
So what you 've got to do is heat the steel , melt the <unk> , the <unk> flow of these <unk> , and the stones are <unk> back to the surface .
Today I used a microwave oven , because I ca n't bring the big machine <unk> here onstage .
The microwave oven is a similar system .
I put the show , which now I 'm going to take you to see what happened .
This is the show that comes out now .
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples .
So we tried a lot of samples there and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , `` Well , that 's very interesting . We have to try . ''
So we gave us a piece of road , 400 meters from the <unk> expressway that we had to make a lane lane test this material .
So that 's what we did there . You see where we were doing the road test , and then , of course , this road lasts several years without any damage . That 's what we know about practice .
We took a lot of samples of this road , and we test them in the lab .
We did aging the samples , we put a lot of charges in them , and they actually know them with our induction machine and set them up , and we put them back to them .
We can do this a lot of times .
Well , to conclude , I can actually say that we 've made a material using iron fibers , bringing these fibers , using the energy of induction for , to actually increase the life of the road surface , even can double the surface of the surface , actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
And now , of course , they 're curious about this also , it worked .
We still have the sample here . It 's pretty hot .
Actually , you have to cool first before you can show you how repairability acts .
But I 'm going to do an attempt .
Let 's see . Yes , it worked .
Thank you .
When I was 11 years old , I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house .
My father was listening to BBC , from his little gray radio .
I had a great smile on his face that was unusual at the time , because the news generally <unk> it .
`` The Taliban went ! '' `` The Taliban were . ''
I did n't know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
`` You can go to a real school , '' he told me .
One morning I 'll never forget .
One real school .
You see , I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> out of Afghanistan and made the girls to go to school .
For the next five years , I was <unk> as a child to join my older sister , who could no longer be alone , to go to a secret school .
It was the only way that we could be able to educate ourselves .
Every day , we made a different route so that no one could suspect where we were going .
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that it looks shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in a little room .
It was nice in the winter , but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew about our lives , the teacher , the students and our parents .
Every time , school had suddenly closed for a week , because the Taliban <unk> .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Are we following us ?
Did you know where we lived ?
We were <unk> , but still , the school was where we wanted to be .
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters had .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan , <unk> that his daughter , my mother , went to school , and so his father would hide it .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
This is her .
He retired two years ago , just to turn our house to girls and girls from our neighborhood .
And my father , this is , was the first of his family to get education .
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education , even their daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was an increased risk of not to educate her children .
Over the years of the Taliban , I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life , and I was always scared and I did n't see a future .
I wanted to give up , but my father said , `` <unk> , my daughter , you can lose everything you have in life .
You can steal your money . You can force yourself to leave your house for a war .
But there is one thing that will always be with you , what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education , we 'll do it .
So you still do n't want to continue ? ''
Today I 'm 22 .
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war .
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than high school , and if my family had n't been so engaged with my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I find myself proud to graduate at <unk> College .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was <unk> from her home by the courage to educate her daughters , was one of the first to congratulate me .
He did n't just stand up from my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and I 'm the first woman , who carry it on the streets of Kabul .
My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk> .
That 's why I 'm the global ambassador of <unk> , a global campaign to educate women .
It 's why I cofounded <unk> <unk> , the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan , a country that is still risky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity .
And I see her parents and his families who , like mine , <unk> for them , despite the way to a grim opposition .
As Ahmed . It 's not his name , and I ca n't show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter went along from <unk> to her village , and literally , it was escaped to be killed by a bomb on the road for minutes .
When you get to your house , you 're the phone , a voice <unk> that if you kept sending her daughter to school , you 'd come back to him .
`` <unk> , if you want , '' he said , `` but it does n't harm the future of my daughter by his old and <unk> ideas . ''
What I 've realized in Afghanistan , and it 's something that is often forgotten in the West , is that behind most of us <unk> , there 's a father who recognized their daughter 's value , and he sees that success of her own success .
It does n't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success .
In fact , often they are the first <unk> <unk> of their daughters , but in the context of a society like Afghanistan , we need the support of men .
Under the Taliban , the girls who went to school are told in hundreds of -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes .
I fear that these changes would n't last long , after retirement in American troops .
But when I go back to Afghanistan , when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them , that I see them , I see a future <unk> and a lasting change .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and unlimited possibilities , and every day the girls of <unk> remember me .
Like me , they dream big .
Thank you .
Never , I 've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in exile : `` <unk> , resist Gaddafi . <unk> Gaddafi .
But you never go back a revolutionary style . ''
They 've spent nearly two years since the <unk> revolution broke by <unk> <unk> of the Tunisian <unk> revolution .
A forces with many other <unk> citizens , inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of Gaddafi .
And we did it ; it was a big revolution .
Women and young men were in the cutting edge , they pushing each of the regime , carrying `` freedom '' , dignity and social justice .
You 've shown an <unk> <unk> to face the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .
They 've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Far East , to the west , to the south .
Finally , after a period of six months of brutal war , and about 50,000 dead war , we managed to release our country and remove the tyrant .
However , Gaddafi left a heavy load , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds .
For four decades , the <unk> regime of Gaddafi destroyed the infrastructure , the culture and the moral structure of the <unk> society .
Be aware of the devastation and the challenges , I 've loved , along with a lot of other women , rebuild the <unk> civil society , pushing a inclusive and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
There are about 200 organizations in <unk> during , and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi , about 300 to <unk> .
After a <unk> period of exile , I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm , I started organizing workshops on the skills of skills , and leadership skills .
With an incredible group of women , we founded the <unk> of Women 's <unk> , a movement of women , the leaders , of a very diverse orientation , to advocate advocate for the <unk> range of women and for our right of interest in the building of democracy and peace .
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> , which will become the selfish political policies of dominance and exclusion .
Over time , our initiative was approved and successful .
Women won a <unk> percent of the National Congress in the first election for 52 years .
However , slowly the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole , they were disappearing ; every day we were found news news .
One day we woke up with the news of the old mosques of ancient mosques and graves .
Another day , with the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack on the <unk> .
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder officers of the military .
And every day , every day , we woke up with the government of militias and the <unk> of human rights in prisoners and their lack of respect for law .
Our society , made up for a revolutionary mindset , became more , and there 's gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom , dignity , social justice , we had at the beginning .
<unk> , exclusion , became the icons of the consequences of the revolution .
I 'm not here at all today at all to inspire our history of success from the <unk> list and the elections .
Now I 'm here today to confess to a confess that we are , as a nation , we chose the wrong decision .
We do n't prioritize right .
Because elections did n't have brought peace , stability and security to Libya .
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and reconciliation brought in peace and reconciliation ?
No , they did n't .
What happened then ?
Why do our society remains polarized and dominated with dominance selfish policies and exclusion , both by men like women ?
Perhaps what was missing were not only women , but women 's values of compassion and mercy and inclusion .
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus as much of what the choices needed , which only restore polarization and division .
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the woman who need the numerical and quantitative representation of it .
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and calling days of anger .
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
We need to develop a female speech , not only <unk> , but it also puts mercy in practice , instead of revenge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion .
These are the ideals that a Libya , mangled by war , desperately desperately with the end of reaching peace .
Because peace has a stakes that it is about the <unk> and the <unk> between female perspectives and male .
That 's the real <unk> .
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk> .
According to the <unk> of the Koran -- peace -- `` it is the word of merciful God , [ <unk> , compassionate . ''
At the time , the word `` <unk> , '' which is known in all the traditions of the <unk> , has the same root as in Arabic that the word `` <unk> '' -- -- -- and <unk> feminine and motherly , which spans the whole humanity of men and women , that all of the tribes and all the peoples have <unk> .
And so , like the uterus covered completely the embryo , that grows inside , the divine matrix of compassion is all the existence .
So it says to us , `` My mercy spans the things . ''
So it says to us , `` My mercy 's prevalent about my anger . ''
They 're all given the grace of mercy .
Thank you .
I 'm here today to talk to you about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing response .
It 's about the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I 'm going to address is the one that everybody does forever : Why is she left ?
Why would anyone stay with a man who sticks on it ?
I 'm not a psychiatrist , not a social worker , no expert in domestic violence .
I 'm just a woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 years old . I was just <unk> at Harvard University .
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first green <unk> green Express , and I had a very large secret .
My secret was that many , many times , the man , that I create my twin soul , and he was going to head with a gun , charged with <unk> bullets .
The man , who loved anyone in this world , put a gun on my head and she threatened to kill me more times than I can remember .
I 'm here to tell you the story of `` crazy love , '' a psychological trap , in love in love , where every year millions of women fall and even some men .
It could even be his story .
I do n't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence .
I 'm <unk> in English at Harvard University , and I have an MBA in <unk> from <unk> Business School .
I 've spent most of my career working for the Fortune 500 list , between Johnson & Johnson , Leo <unk> and The Washington Post .
I 've nearly 20 years old for 20 years with my second husband , and we have three children .
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone , all races , all the religions , all levels of income and education .
It 's everywhere .
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is happening to women , which is a problem of women .
Not exactly .
More than 85 percent of those are men , and domestic abuse only happens in intimate relationships , interdependent and <unk> , or , said , in the families , the last place we would like or expect to find violence , why , the domestic abuse , is so puzzling .
I would have told them that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be given , and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age .
I was 22 years old , and in the United States , the women of ages 16 and 24 , they have three times more likely to be the victims of domestic violence that each other ages , and over 500 women and girls who are killed every year by couples , boyfriends and abusive husbands in the United States .
I was also a typical victim because I did n't know anything about domestic violence , their warning signals or their patterns .
I met <unk> on a cold and wet night of January .
I was sitting next to me in the New York subway , and it started to meet me .
He told me two things .
The first one was , he was also <unk> from an Ivy League University , and he was working on a very important bank of Wall Street .
But what struck me most of it was that I was ready and fun , and that looked like a field of the field .
I had some big <unk> , and a <unk> hair , and it seemed so sweet .
One of the smartest things that he did , from the beginning , was creating the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner .
He did it especially at the beginning , on a pedestal .
We started out and loved everything of me : he was ready , he had gone to Harvard , who became a passion for teenage girls , and my job .
I wanted to know all about my family , my childhood , my dreams and illusions .
<unk> believed in me , as a writer and as a woman , as no one had ever done .
And that was why the Bachelor of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him .
I did n't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is seduced and <unk> the victim .
And I did n't know that the second step is <unk> .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving my dreams of my dreams , but I thought I had to do for your partner , so I accepted , I quit my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan .
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> love , who was entering a physical trap , financial and psychological trap .
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to .
And here 's where those guns enter these guns .
As soon as we moved to New England , you know , that place where you 're supposed to feel so safe , you bought three guns .
One was in the <unk> of the car .
Another one , he kept him under the pillow in our bed and the third time in his pocket .
And he said he needed those guns because of the trauma that lived small .
He needed them to feel safe .
But those guns were actually a message to me , and although I never had raised my hand , my life was already in real danger , every minute of every day .
The first physical attack was five days before our wedding .
It was seven in the morning , and I still had the <unk> .
Five days later , when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared , I put my mother 's girlfriend 's girlfriend , and I married him .
Even though what had happened , I was sure that we were living happily lived forever , because I loved him , and he also wanted a lot of it .
And I was very , very genuine .
It just felt very overwhelmed by the wedding and the fact of making a family with me .
It was an isolated accident , and it would never make me hurt .
I spent two times more on our moon of honey .
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and lost me , and he gave me so strong in the head that I 'd put several times against the window of the car .
And then , a couple of days later , driving around our moon of honey , ran through traffic and threw a Big Mac cold on the face .
<unk> followed by <unk> , or twice a week for the next two years of our marriage .
I wondered when I thought it was the only one in this situation .
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life , and the Center for Disease Control informs every year 15 million children are abused , 15 million .
So , actually , I had very good company .
So let 's go back to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is simple .
I did n't know he was abusing me .
Instead , I was a very strong woman , in love with a profoundly <unk> man , and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> his demons .
The other question that everybody does is : Why do n't we just go ?
Why did n't I go ? I could have gone at any time .
To me , this is the most sad and agonizing question that people do , because us , the victims , we know something that you normally ignore : it 's incredibly dangerous to give up a <unk> .
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill her .
Over 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence , after the victim has finally gotten to the relationship , after then the <unk> has nothing to lose .
Other repercussions include permanent harassment , even after the <unk> has gone to get married , not for financial resources , and manipulation of the family judicial system , who normally are forced by judges to spend time <unk> with the man to <unk> their mother .
And we still follow asking why why does n't it just go ?
I was able to go , and I was able to go , because of one last beat up to my denial .
I realized that the man who loved so much , would have killed me if it had been allowed .
So I broke the silence .
I told everyone around the world : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , full unknown , and I 'm here today because you all helped me .
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims like spooky headlines , women , <unk> goods .
The question , `` Why is it left ? ''
For some people , it 's a way to say , `` It 's his fault to stay , '' as if the victims <unk> <unk> by men who want to destroy us .
But since I published `` <unk> Love '' -- I 've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also got out , who learned a lesson that had learned about what happened to them , and that <unk> their lives of life and happy , wives and mothers , completely free lives of violence , like mine .
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence .
I became marrying a cute and nice man , and we have these three children .
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk> .
What I wo n't get back to you , ever , is a pistol charged by telling my head in somebody who says that he wants me .
At this point , you 're thinking , `` <unk> , that 's fascinating ! '' or `` <unk> , what kind of stupid it was ! ''
I assure you that there are a few people , who are listening to me right now , who are being battered , or they were being battered , or they are being battered them .
<unk> could be affecting their daughter , their sister , to their best friend right now .
I was able to end my crazy love , breaking the silence .
And I keep doing it today .
It 's my way to help other victims , and it 's my last request to you .
Talk about what you 've heard here .
<unk> can only thrive in silence .
They have the power to end domestic violence just throwing light on it .
The victims need everyone else .
We need each one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
Take the abuse of light talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
They <unk> their vision for survivors like fantastic and charming people , who have a full future .
He <unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously , to stop their climb and show the victims a safe output .
Together we can turn our beds , our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful oasis should be .
Thank you .
Hi . So I call Cameron Russell , and for a while , I 'm a model .
To be precise , for 10 years .
And I feel that right now , there 's an awkward tension in the room , because I should n't have dressed myself like that , luckily , I 've brought clothes to change .
This is the first shift in a TED stage , so you 're very lucky to <unk> , I think .
If some of the women were <unk> when I came up , they do n't have to tell me now , but I 'll find out later on Twitter .
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of power to change what I think about me in just 10 seconds .
Not everybody has that opportunity .
These heels are very uncomfortable -- less wrong than I do n't have to use them .
The worst part is to go through this sweater by your head , because it 's when you 're going to laugh at me , so you do n't do anything while you cover my head .
All right .
Why have I done this ?
It 's been embarrassing .
Well , I hope not as much as this picture .
The appearance is powerful , but also shallow .
I 've totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had never had a boyfriend in real life .
I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer told me that I would put my back on my back , and I 'll get my hair off of the guy .
Of course , except with surgery or an artificial tan like that I made two days for the work , there 's very little that we can do to transform our aspect , which , even though surface and unchanging , has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , for me , being brave means being honest .
I 'm on this stage because I 'm a model .
Because I 'm a nice , white woman , and in my work sector , that 's a sexy girl .
I 'm going to answer the questions that people always do , but very honest .
The first question is , how do you get a model ?
And I always say , `` An <unk> figured out , but that does n't mean anything .
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery , and I 'm a beneficiary of a heritage , and maybe you 're wondering what this heritage is .
Well , in the last few centuries , we have not only defined beauty as health , youth and symmetry , which we are biologically programmed to admire , we 've also associated with a high and <unk> figure , to womanhood and a white skin .
And that is my heritage , heritage that I 've learned to take money for money .
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing you skeptical , and maybe there 's some <unk> lovers saying -- `` Wait . '' There they are Naomi , <unk> , Joan <unk> , Liu Wen .
First of all , the <unk> are so much models . It 's amazing .
But unfortunately , I have to report that in 2007 , a Ph.D. student from the University of New York later , and every one of the models on the runway , and the <unk> models , the only 27 , is to say , less than four percent , were not white .
The next question that people always do is , could it be able to be a model when it 's bigger ?
And my first answer is : I do n't know , I do n't care about that .
But then , what I would really tell you every one of these girls is : Why ? You can be whatever you want .
You can be president of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a <unk> surgeon , which would be awesome , because you were the first .
If after this spectacular list , you still insist , no , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , then I say , `` I know my boss .
Because I 'm not in charge of anything , and you could be the head of an American <unk> magazine or the CEO of H & M , or next Steven <unk> .
To say that you want to be a model to say you want to win the lottery , when you 're bigger .
It 's out of your control , it 's amazing , and it 's not a job that you can choose .
I 'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model , because , unlike <unk> surgery , it can be summarized right now .
I do n't know what happened there .
Unfortunately , once you 've finished your studies , and you have a rsum , and you have a curriculum and you have a curriculum and some jobs and your back to your back , is , if you said that you want to be president from the United States , but your rsum would say , `` Model <unk> , '' for 10 years , people would look weird
The next question that people always do is whether all of the photos were <unk> .
And yes , they 're pretty <unk> all the photos , but that 's just a small part of what happens .
This was the first picture that they took me , and also the first time I used a bikini , and I did n't even have a period of time .
I know we 're entering the personal terrain , but it was a little girl .
This is how it looked along with my grandmother a few months before .
These two pictures are the same day .
My friend came with me .
Here I am at a slumber party a few days before the French <unk> .
Here I am with my football team and the magazine magazine .
And this is me today .
And I hope you realize that I 'm not me in those pictures .
These are creations of professionals , <unk> , <unk> , photographers and <unk> , and all of their <unk> and <unk> people , and they get to create this . That 's not me .
Well , the next question that people are always doing is : Do we have fun things ?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and I 'd never use , except the first couple , but the privilege I get , I get the ones I get in the real life , and that we do n't like to talk .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I once went to a store and I forgot about bringing money , and they gave me a free dress .
When I was a teenager , I was traveling with my friend who was a bad driver ; I jumped down a red light , and , of course , you stood up , and it took one sorry , agent so I can keep driving .
And these privilege of these privilege is , not for what I am , and there are people who are paying a price for their appearance , no matter who they are .
I live in New York , and last year , from the <unk> teenagers who were given and <unk> , 86 percent were black and Latino , and most of them were young men .
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York , so for them , it 's not a matter of <unk> ?
But how many times do I mean ? And when ?
When I investigate this talk , I found out that the 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States do n't like your body , and that figure rises by 78 percent to the 17 .
So the last question that people do is : How is life of a model ?
And I think the answer that you 're waiting for is : If you 're a little thinner , you get the smartest hair , you 'll feel very happy and great .
And behind the cameras , we take an answer that maybe that looks like this .
We say , it 's really wonderful to travel , and also incredible power to work with creative , resourceful , passionate people .
And all of that is true , but it 's just one part of what happens , because what 's going on , what we 're never saying , in front of the cameras , what I 've never said in front of them is : I 'm insecure .
And I 'm because I have to worry about me every day .
And if you ever ask yourself , `` With a thinner , <unk> legs , will be happier ? ''
They only have to meet with a group of models , because they have the thinner legs , the brighter hair and the <unk> , but they 're probably the most unsafe women on the planet .
But most of it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender of gender when I 'm one of the biggest <unk> .
If there is something that you retain from this talk , I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of image in the perception that we have of success and failure .
Thank you .
The photograph has been my passion since I was getting a camera , but I want to share with you my 15 most precious pictures , and I did n't get them who pulled them .
There were no artistic directors , no <unk> , no opportunity to repeat the photos , not even a minimum minimum in lighting .
In fact , most of them took tourists randomly .
My story begins when , in New York City to give a lecture , my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday . That 's the corner of 57 and five .
And he happened to be back to New York City just a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well you can imagine what comes right now .
When the third birthday of my daughter was approaching my daughter , my wife told me , `` Why do n't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey , and move the ritual ? ''
So here 's when we started to ask the tourists that they 're going to tell us the picture .
It 's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera is so universal .
No one 's ever been denied and , fortunately , no one has ever dealt with the camera .
So , we were n't aware of how much the life would change this journey .
It became a sacred thing for us .
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old could understand .
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey .
It 's also a way to stop time at October , and we think about our time and our evolution over the years , and not just at the physical level , but in all the senses .
Because , even though we always took the same picture , our perspective changes , my daughter drives new landmarks , and I can see life through his eyes and how perceive it and interact with everything .
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion every year .
Recently , in one of the trips , we were walking , when all of a sudden , he stopped in dry and pointed a red <unk> from the store of the dollhouse that I loved small on earlier visits .
And he described to me what felt like the five years of foot in that same place .
And that reminded me that he remembered his heart was <unk> by looking at that place for the first time nine years .
And now what looks in New York are universities , because it 's determined to study in New York .
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories .
So , I want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious creation of memories .
I do n't know you , but apart from these 15 pictures , I do n't go out in many of the familiar photos .
I 'm always the one that pulls out the picture .
Now , I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture , and you do n't want to get around to someone and ask you , `` Give us a picture ? ''
Thank you .
I 'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
<unk> are in the most threatened group of birds .
First of all , why do they have so bad press ?
It has also been associated with Disney laughs like <unk> , stupid , stupid characters .
More recently , if you 've been following the press , you 've got laughter and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to Kenyan Parliament . But I do n't accept it .
I do n't accept it . You know why ?
Because the members of Parliament do not clean the environment , <unk> are not helping prevent the spread of disease .
It 's hardly monogamous . They 're far away from extinct . And my favorite , the rabbits have better presence . There are two types of rabbits on this planet .
There are rabbits in New World who are primarily in the Americas , like the <unk> and the <unk> , and the Old World rabbits , where we have 16 species -- of these 16 , 11 is a high risk of extinction .
So , why rabbits are important ? First of all , provide life green services . <unk> .
They are our heritage from natural junk .
They 're going to get dead bodies to the bone .
They help kill all the bacteria . They help absorb the anthrax that is not being made by them , and it would cause massive losses to livestock and diseases in other animals .
Recent studies have been shown that in areas where there are no rabbits , the dead bodies take three to four times more time in being broken , and this has huge branches in the spread of disease .
<unk> also have huge historical importance .
They 've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture .
<unk> was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood and , along with the king cobra , <unk> the unit between the chief and below Egypt .
In the Indian mythology , <unk> was the god <unk> , and he risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> culture , they are very important to <unk> sky , and in places like Tibet , there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> , so these rabbits provide a natural disposal system .
What 's the problem with rabbits ?
We have eight species of rabbits in Kenya , which six are extremely endangered endangered .
The reason is that they 're being poisoned , and the reason that they are being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and wildlife . <unk> communities use this venom against predators , and as a result , rabbits are victims of this .
In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of rabbits are on the critical critical list of extinction , which means that in less than 10 or 15 years , they 're <unk> , and the reason is because they fall prey from livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk> .
This drug has been banned by veterinarian in India , and they 've taken a position .
Since there is no rabbits , there 's been a spread on the number of dogs on the street in landfills , and when you have the street dogs , you have a huge time bomb for anger , the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa : <unk> <unk> is going to be up at the top of Lake Turkana .
I 'm not against wind energy , but we have to work with the governments , because the wind turbines do this to the birds , they cut them down for half .
They 're <unk> birds .
In Western Africa , there 's a terrible trade of rabbits dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market .
So what 's being done ? Well , we 're looking at these birds . We 're <unk> transmitters .
We 're trying to determine its basic ecology , and see where they go .
We can see that they travel across different countries , so focusing on a problem locally is not going to serve .
We have to work with governments on regional levels .
We 're working with the local communities .
We 're talking to them about appreciate rabbits , about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that provide .
How can you help ? It can become assets , making noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell you , we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures . <unk> their time to spread the word . <unk> the word .
When you walk out of this room , they will tell you about rabbits , but talk to their families , with their children , with their neighbors about rabbits .
They 're very elegant . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind , because he saw him fly effortlessly , without any energy spending in the heavens .
Kenya , this world , will be much more poor without these wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
Each thing I do and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been molded by seven years of work during my youth in Africa .
<unk> to 1977 , <unk> young , but I 'm not . I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Cote d'Ivoire , Algeria and Somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every project that we set up in Africa failed .
And I was very disturbed .
I was thinking , 21 , that the Italians were good , and we were doing good work in Africa .
Instead , everything we were playing out of .
Our first project , which inspired my first book , `` <unk> of the <unk> '' -- was a project where we decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food .
So we got seeds in southern Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley , and we teach local people to grow Italian and <unk> tomatoes .
And of course , people were n't at all interested in doing that , so they were <unk> to come to work , and sometimes they do n't get to work . We were late from the locals , in so fertile valley , they would n't have been agriculture .
However , instead of asking you how it was possible that we did n't want to leave anything , we just said , `` Thank God we 're here . '' `` Just time to save people in Zambia of famine . ''
And of course , everything in Africa became beautifully .
We got these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy , it would grow to this size , in Zambia , to this size .
And we could n't believe it , we were telling them , `` Look how easy to be agriculture . ''
When the tomatoes were beautiful , mature and red ones , overnight , about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything , and we said to the <unk> , `` Oh my God , the <unk> ! ''
And the <unk> said , `` Yes , that 's why we do n't have agriculture here . '' `` Why did n't they say it ? '' `` You never asked . ''
I thought only of us would make mistakes in Africa , but then , I saw what Americans did , what the British <unk> did , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia .
Because , as you see , at least we feed the <unk> .
I mean , we 'll see the waste -- it 's <unk> to see the waste that we would give you to <unk> people from Africa .
She wants to read a book , read `` <unk> <unk> '' -- <unk> economist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We , Western donors , we 've given the continent of Africa two million dollars in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you about damage that that money has caused .
Just read your book .
<unk> from an African woman , the damage we 've done .
Now , Westerners are imperialists , <unk> <unk> , and we treat people only in two ways : or we teach them , or we 're <unk> .
The two words come from the Latin , `` <unk> , '' meaning `` father . ''
Yet they mean two different things .
<unk> , I treat any of a different culture as if they were my children . `` I want you a lot . ''
<unk> , I deal with all of a different culture like my maids were .
That 's why white people in Africa are called `` <unk> , '' chief .
That book gave me a slap in the face , `` <unk> is beautiful , '' written by <unk> , who said for all of the economic development , if people do n't want to be helped , <unk> alone .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is to respect .
This morning , the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said , `` Can we imagine a city that 's not <unk> ? ''
I decided for 27 , just answer people , and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you 're never starting anything , you 're never starting to get anyone , but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion , the servant of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person .
So , what do you do ? It 's <unk> .
Never come to a community with an idea , and sit with the people in the locality .
We do n't work from the offices .
We got together in a cafe . We sat down in a bar .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what do we do ? We become friends , and we found out what the person wants to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give an idea to someone .
If that person does n't want to do that , what 's going to do you ?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
And then we help them find knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
The person with the idea can not have knowledge , but knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why not us , for once instead of getting a community to tell people what to do , why not , for once , we heard them ? But not community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There 's a problem with community meetings .
<unk> entrepreneurs are never attending , and they will never say , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what a chance they 've identified .
So , planning has this blind point .
The smartest people in their community , you do n't even know them , because they do n't take their public meetings .
What do we do ? We work on one , and we work face to face , you have to create a social infrastructure , which does n't exist .
You should create a new profession .
The profession is the family 's family doctor , the business family doctor , which is established with you in your house , at the table of your kitchen , and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of making a living .
I started this as a test in <unk> , city of Western Australia .
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time , trying to get away from this condescending garbage where we came to tell you what to do .
In a year , I had 27 <unk> projects , and the government came to me to see , `` How can you do that ?
How can you do that ? '' And I said , `` I did something very , very , very hard .
And I fell down and I heard them . '' And then , the government says , `` Do it again . '' We 've done it in 300 communities in the world .
We 've helped to start 40,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of loneliness .
Peter <unk> , one of the greatest business graduates in history , passed away to '96 , a few years ago .
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before involved in business , and this is what Peter <unk> says : `` <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company economy . ''
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business spirit .
So now , <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you .
You have to offer them all of them for them , privacy , you have to be fantastic to help you , and then you go to them , they 're going to come in mass .
In a community of 10,000 people , we got 200 customers .
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , intelligence and passion ?
Which presentation you have to do . Have you ever go this morning ?
<unk> local people . That 's what you 've got .
So , what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is .
We 're at the end of the world 's first industrial revolution , not renewables renewable , manufacturing -- and from one moment , we have systems that are not sustainable .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
<unk> as a way of sustaining machines is not sustainable .
What we need to consider , is how we 're <unk> , we heal , we 're moving , we can communicate to seven billion people , in a sustainable way .
There are no technologies to do that .
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Will the universities match it !
The government ? Forget it !
You 'll be the entrepreneurs and they 're doing it now .
There 's an adorable story that read a lot of years ago , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk> .
And in 1860 , they ran this group of people together , and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years , and the conclusion was <unk> : New York City would n't exist within 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the curve and they talked about , if the population is kept growing up at this rate , to move the population of New York around , <unk> six million horses , and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address .
They were already <unk> in manure , so in 1860 , they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City .
So what happens ? Over the next 40 years , in the United States , in the United States , the U.S. manufacturing companies showed up , <unk> companies .
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few , <unk> , factories in <unk> places .
<unk> , Michigan . Henry Ford .
However , there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to offer them for them .
Otherwise , they would n't come to talk to you .
Then you have to offer them an absolute , dedicated , <unk> service .
And then later , you will have to tell you the truth about it .
The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be able to do three <unk> : the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have a fantastic marketing , and you have to have a great financial administration .
You know what ?
We 've never met a single human being in the world that can do , sell and look for the money alone .
There does n't exist .
This is still not yet born .
We 've investigated and looked at the 100 <unk> companies from Carnegie 's world , ordinary , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There 's only one thing that the successful companies in the world have in common , just one : No one was started by one person .
Never the word `` me , '' but the word `` us '' 32 times .
He was n't just when he started .
Nobody begins a company alone . No one .
So we can create the community where we have facilitators , who come from a small business environment sitting in coffee shops , in bars and their dedicated businesses who will do for you , what somebody did by this gentleman who talks about this epic , someone who 's going to ask you , what needs ?
What can you do ? Can you do it ?
Well , you can sell ? Can you look for money ? ''
`` Oh , no , I ca n't do that . ''
We activate communities .
Thank you .
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives .
We do n't know all the neighbors , so we do n't exchange a lot of knowledge even though we share the same public spaces .
Over the last few years , I 've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space , with simple tools like <unk> , templates and chalk .
These projects came out of questions like , how much do my neighbors pay for their apartments ?
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment ?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our landscape ?
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs today and dreams ?
I live in New Orleans and I 'm in love with New Orleans .
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> of shadow who give shadow to lovers and <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city .
It 's always going to sink the music , there 's a parade in New Orleans . The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world , but also one with the largest number of American properties in the U.S .
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a cooler space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost somebody who loved a lot .
It was Joan , as a mother to me .
His death was sudden and unexpected .
I thought so much about death .
And this made me deep gratitude for the lived time .
It gave it clarity to the significant stuff of my life today .
But let me just keep this look in my daily life .
I think it 's easy to be able to move back and get the day to forget what 's really important for you .
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this left house on a giant board , and he painted on it , phrases that he 's going to be , `` Before I die . ''
So the broadcasters could take a chalk , reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space .
I did n't know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day the wall was bloated , and he kept <unk> .
And I 'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall .
`` Before I die , I want to be judged . '' `` Before I die , I want to sit down on the line of return . ''
`` Before I die , I want to sing for millions of people . ''
`` Before I die , I want to plant a tree . ''
`` Before I die , I want to live outside the Web . ''
`` Before I die , I want to give you more again . ''
`` Before I die , I want to go to someone 's rescue . ''
`` Before I die , I want to be completely myself . ''
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and the hope and hope of people made me laugh , I <unk> , and they gave me comfort in hard times .
It 's about knowing that you 're not alone . It 's about understanding our neighbors in new and <unk> ways . It 's about going to accommodate your reflection and contemplation , and to remember what 's most important for us as we grow and change .
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to do a wall in his community .
So with my colleagues at the civic center , we made a kit , and now they 've made walls in countries around the world , like Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
And together we showed the power of our public spaces , if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other .
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people .
In our age of distractions , it 's more important than ever , finding ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is brief and delicate .
Death is something that we often avoid talking about , or even thinking , but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that became more power .
If you think about the death of your life .
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and more media to share hope , fears and stories , the people around us ca n't only help improve places , can help improve our lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I have a single request today .
Please do n't tell me that I 'm normal .
Now I 'd like to introduce you to my siblings .
<unk> is 22 , and it 's very handsome .
It 's not talking , but it transmits better than some of the best speakers .
<unk> knows what love is .
The shared shares pass what happens .
It 's not <unk> . He does n't look at the color of the skin .
You do n't care about the religious differences and notice this : it 's never lied .
When singing songs of our childhood , trying to speak out of the words that I ca n't even remind myself , it reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that should be unknown .
Samuel is 16 years old . It 's very handsome .
It has the most pristine memory .
However , it 's a selective memory .
It does n't remember if I stole my <unk> , but remember the year when I stole each of the songs from my iPod , conversations we kept when I was four , you 'd be able to pee on my arm during the first episode of the Lady and the Lady Gaga birthday .
Does n't it seem amazing ?
But most people disagree .
And in fact , because your minds do n't fit the concept of normal society , they are often ignored and <unk> .
But what it led to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case , although not consider them inside the ordinary , that could only mean one thing : they were extraordinary , autistic and extraordinary .
Now , for those least familiar with the term `` autism '' is a complex brain disorder affecting social media , learning and sometimes physical skills .
In each individual , it manifests itself differently , from there that is so different to Sam .
And all over the world , every 20 minutes , will be diagnosed with a new case of autism , and although it is one of the developing disorders that faster in the world , there is no cause or cure known .
I do n't agree with my first meeting with autism , but I do n't remember one day without him .
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world , and I was very excited to have a new self to be in my life .
When I was a few months ago , I realized that he was different .
It was a lot .
I did n't want to play like the other babies , and in fact , it did n't seem very interested in me at all .
He lived alive and he was in his own world , with his own world , with his own rules , and he was pleasure in the smallest things , like putting cars in row around the room , looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have between them .
As I grew up , it became more different , and the differences became more obvious .
But beyond the <unk> , the frustration and the endless hyperactivity , there was something really unique : an innocent , innocent nature , a child who saw the world without prejudice , a human being I had never lied .
<unk> .
I ca n't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family , moments that I wish they were just like me .
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality , communication and love , and I realize that they are things that I would n't want to change for normal .
The normality are the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different does n't mean that any of you are wrong .
It just means that there 's a different view of what is right .
If I could reach one thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you , it would be that you do n't have to be normal .
They can be extraordinary .
Because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- they 're a gift , each one of us has a gift inside and , honestly , the pursuit of normality is the last possible sacrifice .
The opportunity for greatness , the progress and change die at the time when we 're trying to be like the others .
Please -- do n't tell me that I 'm normal .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced a little bit what has been to be Alice in the Country of Wonders .
Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , who gave a kind of communication to engineering students .
I was scared . It was really afraid of these students with their great minds , his big , big books and their big , unknown words .
But when those conversations were developed , I felt what Alice should be felt when he fell through the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world .
So I sat down when I had those conversations with students . I was surprised the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world as well .
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication .
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges , from energy to environment and health care , between others , and if we do n't understand this , the work is not done , and I think it 's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions .
But these big conversations ca n't happen if our scientists and engineers do n't invite us to see their wonderful world .
So scientists and engineers , please , <unk> with <unk> .
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive .
First one question for <unk> : and then what ?
<unk> why science is relevant to us .
They do n't tell us simply to study the <unk> , but they study the <unk> , which are the mesh structure of our bones , because it 's important to understand and treat osteoporosis .
And when you 're describing their science , carefully with the jargon .
The lingo is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Sure , can you say `` spatial and temporary , '' but why not say `` space and time '' which is much more accessible to us ?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them dumb .
Instead , as Einstein said , that everything is as simple as possible , but not simple .
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise .
And something to consider is to use examples , stories and analogies , they 're ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content .
And by presenting their work , forget about the signs of `` bullet . ''
Have you asked why they call bullets ? What bullets do ? bullets kill , and they 're going to kill their presentation .
An <unk> like this is not only boring , but it 's supporting too much in the area of the language of our brain and drives us .
Instead , this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective . It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
The trick here is to use a simple phrase , legible , that the audience can understand if it 's lost a little bit , and then to provide graphs that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it 's described .
And I think these are just some key ones that can help us the door to the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering .
And so scientists and engineers , when you 've solved this equation , all the media , <unk> with <unk> . Thank you .
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English Dictionary is `` <unk> . ''
Just because it sounds pretty good .
And `` <unk> '' means `` politician '' means .
Although there was a journalism publisher of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said , `` A <unk> is that he 's looking for a public charge without matter , platform or principle , and that , when he wins , he gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk> . ''
I have no idea what `` <unk> '' means .
Something to do with words , I guess .
It 's very important that words are the foundation in politics , and that all politicians know they have to try to master language .
It was n't until , for example , that the British Parliament enabled newspapers to quote the exact words they were told in the parliamentary chamber .
And this was all thanks to the courage of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> , who was faced with Parliament .
They fed him into the London Tower and incarcerated , but he had enough courage to deal with them , and at the end , he had a popular support in London that won .
And only a few years later we had the first <unk> use of the phrase , `` <unk> like the metal . ''
Most people think it 's literal .
It 's not . It 's for a freedom of freedom of expression .
But to show you really how words and politics interact , I want you to come back to America , just after independence .
So , they had to address the question of how to call George Washington , their leader .
They did n't know .
How do you call the leader of a Republican country ?
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time .
There were all sorts of suggestions that might have <unk> .
Some wanted to call it `` Chief de State of State , '' and others , `` Her <unk> George Washington , '' and other people , `` The U.S. People ' <unk> . ''
Not very appealing .
Some people just wanted to call it `` King . ''
They thought it was <unk> .
And even with it , they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given deadline .
And it could have done .
Everybody has immensely immensely , because this debate would be taken over for three weeks .
I read the diary of a slum Senator , and I always wrote , `` Even with this subject . ''
What caused the delay and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate .
The House 's House did n't want Washington to be empowered .
They did n't want to call it `` King '' if he did he or his wildest ideas .
So , they wanted to give her the <unk> , the most insignificant and more pathetic title .
And that title was `` President . ''
President . I did n't invent the title . It was already done before , but it just meant `` somebody who <unk> a meeting . ''
It was like the president of a jury .
And I did n't have much more <unk> than the term `` foreman '' or `` supervisor . ''
There were <unk> of small colonial <unk> and fractions of government , but it was really a insignificant title .
And that 's why the Senate was posed .
They said , `` It 's ridiculous , we ca n't call it President . ''
`` This guy has to sign treaties and meet foreign <unk> . ''
`` And who will take me seriously with a title as ridiculous and insignificant as President of America ? ''
And finally , after three weeks of debate , the Senate gave up .
We can learn three interesting things about all of this .
First of all , and this is my favorite , until I 've been able to figure out , the Senate has never been involved as the president 's title .
President Barack Obama is lucky to go on , hoping for the Senate between the action .
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary -- it 's possible to keep waiting for <unk> years .
But the third thing that we can learn , and this is the most important thing , and with this , I want to leave you , is that the President of the President of the United States does n't sound as modest today , right ?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads , the biggest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial aerial vehicles and so on .
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk> .
So at the end , I won the Senate .
They got their <unk> title .
And also the other concern with the Senate , the appearance of uniqueness -- well , was a uniqueness of then .
But , you know how many nations have the president now ?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy that has the 5,000 nuclear warheads , and so on .
So in the end , the Senate won and the House 's House , because no one 's going to feel humble when you tell them that they 're the President of the <unk> .
And I think that 's the great lesson that we can learn , and what I 'd like to leave you with .
Politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and use the words to shape and control reality , but really , it changes actually a lot more than the words that what these might change reality .
Thank you very much .
I 'm 45 feet underground in an illegal mine in Ghana .
The air is loaded with heat and dust , and it 's hard to breathe .
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark , but I ca n't see much more .
I hear voices that are talking about , but especially , that cacophony of male <unk> and rocks with primitive tools .
Like the others , I 'm wearing a cheap light flashlight attached to the head with this <unk> rubber band , and I can hardly tell the branches of the branches that hold the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of meters on the ground .
My hand was <unk> , and I suddenly remember a miner I met before , who lost control and countless feet in that pump .
As I talk to you today , these men are deep in the <unk> hole their lives without paying or reward , and often dying .
I went out that hole and I went home , but they might never do it , because they 're prey to slavery .
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in over 70 countries , and in 2009 , I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
Among all the amazing people I met there , I met a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> , an NGO that 's dedicated to eradicate modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , because I knew that there was in the world but not such a degree .
When I finished talking to myself , I was very bad , I was fortunate to ignore this <unk> of our days and thought , `` If I do n't know , how many people do n't know ?
He made me a knot , and , weeks later , I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help .
So my journey to modern slavery .
Interestingly , it had been in many of these sites .
Some of them , even though , did my second home .
But this time , we 're making dirty laundry .
A conservative calculation says that there 's over 27 million people in the world .
It 's twice as much as the number of displaced Africans throughout the entire <unk> slaves .
150 years ago , the cost of a farmer 's slave was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker .
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars of present .
However , today , you can actually enslaving entire families for generations per 18 dollars per 18 dollars .
Remarkably , slavery generates profits from more dollars a year around the world .
Many have been fooled with fake good education promises and better work to find out that they are forced to work without paying , under threat to violence and ca n't escape .
Today , slavery operates in trade : goods produced by slavery , they have value , but those of them produce them are disposable .
<unk> exists in almost everybody , and yet it 's illegal throughout the world .
In India and Nepal , I met the brick furnaces .
This strange , <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the Dante hell .
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C , men , women , entire families , in fact , entire families wrapped up in a heavy <unk> <unk> pile in their heads , until 18 at the time , and they take them from the hot furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of meters .
<unk> for monotony and tiredness work in silence , doing this task over and over again for 16 hours a day .
There was no breaks to eat , not to drink , and it was severe <unk> , and it was hard to pee .
So <unk> were the heat and dust that my camera was too hot , and the touch , and it stopped working .
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> , and sitting there , I thought , my camera receives a much better treatment than these people .
Back in the oven , I wanted to cry , but the <unk> that I was next to me very quickly grabbed me and said , `` Lisa , do n't do it . Do n't do it here . ''
And it explained to me very clearly that I 'll demonstrate emotions to be very dangerous in places like this , not just for me , but for them .
I could n't offer any direct help .
I could n't give them money , nothing .
I was not citizenship in that country .
I could put it in a worse situation than they were already .
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release , and he trusted him .
As soon as I 'm waiting to get home to feel my heart destroyed .
In the Himalayas , I found children dragging stones for miles on <unk> trucks to the bottom .
Those big , big , <unk> -- the kids who 'd charge and children hold their heads with <unk> <unk> made of sticks , ropes and rags .
It 's hard to witness something so overwhelming .
How can we influence something that insidious but ubiquitous ?
Some of them do n't even know that slaves are slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all of his life .
They have nothing to compare to .
When these villagers <unk> their freedom , the <unk> burned their homes .
When you hear the word slavery often , we think of sexual trafficking , and because of this global awareness , they warned me that it would be hard for me to work with safety in this particular business .
In Kathmandu , I became women who had been previously been previously <unk> .
It took me on a <unk> stairs that gave this dirty basement , very dim light light .
It was n't exactly a brothel .
It was a restaurant .
<unk> , as you know in the craft , are local for prostitution prostitution .
They have small rooms , private , where <unk> in <unk> with their girls and children , some of the only seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and to get them to buy more food and alcohol .
Each of them is dark and dirty , identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain .
The workers often suffer sexual abuse by their clients .
From foot in <unk> , I remember having sense a <unk> fear and , at that moment , could barely imagine what 's going to be stuck in that hell .
I just had an exit : the stairs where I walked in .
There was no hind door .
There were no windows big enough to climb .
Those people do n't have <unk> and , because we touch a very difficult topic , it 's important to point out that slavery , even sexual trafficking , happens around us .
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture , in restaurants , in the domestic service , and the list can continue .
Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as sexual slaves .
It 's everywhere , but we do n't see it .
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor with slave labor .
I went to Indian villages in which there were whole families involved in silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
Black 's hands are the father , the <unk> of blue and red , of their children .
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and dip the silk into the liquid to the elbows , but that 's toxic .
My performer told me his stories .
`` We do n't have freedom , '' they said .
`` We still hope , though , though , we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our work . ''
It 's estimated that there are over 4,000 children enslaved in the <unk> , the largest <unk> lake .
When we came up , I went to have a quick look at it .
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a ship , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense ?
Wrong . They were all slaves .
Kids are separated from their aging families , missing and forced to work a lot of these boats in the lake , despite not knowing swimming .
This child is eight years old .
When our boat came up to me was shivering ; it feared his little canoe were <unk> .
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water .
The <unk> branches of <unk> trees in the lake will often catch networks and children , <unk> and fear , they 're thrown into the water to release the branches .
Many are drowned .
Ever since remember , it 's always been forced to work in the lake .
And for fear of his love , he 's not going to run away , and as life has been treated with cruelty , <unk> about the younger slaves under its command .
I met these kids at five in the morning , when they were following the last few nets , but they had been working from one .
It 's in the cold and <unk> night .
And it would just point out that these webs weigh over 400 pounds when they 're packed with fish .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was rescued in a <unk> village .
I met him in a refuge in which he <unk> the <unk> ' <unk> victims .
Kofi symbolizes as possible .
Who are going to be because of someone decided to make a difference in their life ?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> , a partner <unk> with his bike suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window .
It asked us to <unk> it down a way to the forest .
At the end of the road , we were getting excited to go out of the car , and asked the driver to go quickly .
Then I pointed this way , and he said , `` This is the way , this is the way . Come on . ''
As we start to go down , we take away the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour , what we found is that the path was <unk> by the recent rains , so I put the pictures of the photos on my head as it went into these waters to the chest .
After two hours of walking , the <unk> path ended abruptly ended , and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a football field , and they 're all full of <unk> workers .
Many women had children strapped on their backs , and as they were looking for gold , they walked in <unk> waters of mercury .
The mercury is used in the process of extraction .
These miners are enslaved in a well in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the well , they were steeped in their own sweat .
I remember looking at his eyes tired , <unk> , because many had been underground for 72 hours .
The pits have to be 90 feet up , and these people carry heavy stone bags that are then shipped back to another area where they 're going to get the stone to extract the gold .
To the first view , the site seems to be filled strong and strong men , but if we look closer , the margin we see at the less fortunate we see another less fortunate and also children .
All of them are victims and diseases and violence .
In fact , it 's very likely that this bully will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and the newborn poisoning in a few years .
This is <unk> . When he died his father his uncle , her uncle took him to work with him in the mines .
When he died , he was a <unk> of the uncle 's debt that force to be a slave in the mines .
When I met him , I 'd worked in the 14 years of mine , and the leg injury you see here is a product of an accident in the mine , so serious that the doctors were saying it should be <unk> .
In addition to that , <unk> has tuberculosis , and yet , it 's forced to work at night and day in that mine .
Still , he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists , like <unk> the <unk> , and it 's this kind of determination , from face to a remote possibility , which inspires me a lot of respect .
I want to drop a light on slavery .
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world .
I wanted to know that you knew that we 're going to be testimony to them and we will do everything we could to help change their lives .
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
These images are not magazines . These are people , real people , like you , who deserve the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
There is n't a day that happens that I do n't think of these so many beautiful , battered people that I 've had the great honor to meet .
I hope that these images wake up a force in people like you , and I hope that that force turns on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery , because , without that light , the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows .
Thank you very much .
I make mathematics applied , and there 's a particular problem for whom , we are like management consultants .
Nobody knows what the hell we do .
So I 'm going to try and explain to you what I do .
Dance is one of the most human activities .
We 're going to give us the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk> that we 'll see later on .
But ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training , a high level of skill and probably some initial fitness that well can have a genetic component .
Unfortunately , neurological disorders like Parkinson 's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who , in his time , was a ballet dancer from ballet .
In the last few years , it has made a lot of progress on treatment .
However , there are <unk> millions of people in the world that are sick , and they have to deal with an incurable weakness , tremor , stiffness and other symptoms of this disease , so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it 's too late .
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way , and ultimately , the only way we 're going to know if there is really a cure that we 're going to be when we have an objective measure , and we have an objective measure .
But it 's frustrating that Parkinson 's disease and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers . That 's why they do n't have blood analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> neurological test .
You have to go to a clinic to do it . It 's very , very expensive , and that means that , outside of clinical trials , they never do . It 's never done .
And what if patients could do that at home ?
Would that save a trip to go to the clinic , what if patients could get their test themselves ?
It would n't be personal .
By the way , it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic .
So , what I want to propose to you is not conventional to you to try , you see , in some sense at least , we 're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk> .
This is a video of the vibration of the vocal chords .
It shows someone healthy as it emits . We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet , because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs , because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds , and we all have the genes necessary . The <unk> , for example .
And , like ballet , it requires an extraordinary training level .
Let 's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak .
From sound , we can track the position of vocal chords as they vibrate , and like that Parkinson 's affects the limbs , it also affects vocal organs .
On the bottom , you can see an <unk> <unk> example of the vocal chords .
We see the same symptoms .
<unk> , weakness and stiffness .
The speech becomes <unk> and <unk> after a while , and this is an example of symptoms .
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with specialized clinical trials ? Well , they 're both non-invasive .
The neurological test is not non-invasive . They both use existing infrastructure .
You do n't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them .
And both of them are skillful . Okay , but also exams based on voice , they 're not specialized .
I mean , they can be <unk> .
They 're very quickly done , they take about 30 seconds as a lot .
They 're at minimum cost , and we all know what happens .
When something takes a cost so low : it appears in a massive scale .
These are some incredible goals to address .
We can reduce the burden of patients .
You do n't need to go to the clinic for <unk> .
With high-speed monitoring , we could get a target data .
We could make massive recruiting very low clinical trials for clinical trials , for the first time , workable scale .
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> for the disease before it 's too late .
So by giving you the first steps in that sense , we 're launching the Parkinson 's <unk> Initiative .
Together with <unk> and <unk> , we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals .
We have very accessible lines for 750 million people in the world .
Anyone , with Parkinson 's or not Parkinson 's , can be able to attract low price and leave recordings for a few cents , and I 'm pleased to announce that we 've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours .
Thank you . Tom Rielly : So Max , taking all these samples from , let 's say 10,000 people will be able to say who 's healthy and who does n't ?
What about these samples ?
Max Little Little <unk> : Yeah , yeah . What happens is , during the call , you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease . TR : Sure .
<unk> : You see , some people can not pass it . You may not end it .
But we 're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances , and doing it in different circumstances is important because we 're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in search of real <unk> .
TR : Do you have 86 percent accuracy right now ?
<unk> : Much more than that .
Actually , my <unk> student , I have to <unk> , has done a fantastic job , and it has now been shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well , what we 're going to do is , now we have a 99 percent accuracy .
TR : Ninety and nine . Well , it 's an improvement .
<unk> : Absolutely .
TR : Thank you very much . Max Little <unk> .
<unk> : Thank you , Tom .
Before March , 2011 , I made <unk> <unk> in New York City .
We are <unk> creatures , gray .
We <unk> ourselves in the dark , in no windows and , by the general , we avoid sunlight .
We make the thin models even thinner , the perfect light , even more perfect skin we do the impossible , but some of us are <unk> in the press all the time , but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography .
On March 11 , 2011 , I saw from my house , like the rest of the world , the tragic event that happened in Japan .
Soon after , an organization where he was voluntary , <unk> <unk> , was in the room working as part of the response team .
I , along with hundreds of other volunteers , we knew we could n't stay sitting at home , so I decided to join the group for three weeks .
On May 13 , I went to <unk> .
It 's a little fishermen town located in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people , one of the first towns affected by the wave .
The <unk> water level reached over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers inside .
As you can imagine , the village was crushed .
We got the rubble out of the channels and the ditches .
We took the schools . We took the mud and we leave the houses to be renovated and <unk> .
We took tons of <unk> , smelly fish <unk> of the local factory .
We were <unk> and we loved it .
For weeks , both volunteers as they found similar things .
They found photos and album and photographs and <unk> cards .
They all did the same thing .
<unk> and bring them to different places of the villages of around to <unk> them .
It was n't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that that people had suffered .
While fleeing the wave , and save their lives , they had to abandon absolutely everything they had .
At the end of my first week , I started to help in a <unk> center of the village .
It helped clean the communal bathrooms in the huge , gigantic <unk> .
This place turned out to be the place of the town where the <unk> center would pick up the photos .
And they had the honor and I had the honor that that day I would take in me to clean up the photos .
This was exciting and inspiring , I had heard the expression thinking beyond the horizons , but it was n't until it went through myself my horizons that something happened .
By looking at the pictures , I found some that had over a hundred years , a few of them were still in the lab , I could n't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing .
So that night I went into Facebook , contacted some of them , and the next morning , the answer was so overwhelming and positive , that I knew we had to try .
So we started playing pictures .
This was the first of all .
It was n't too <unk> , but where the water had been destroyed the face of the girl , I had to get up with a lot of precision and <unk> .
Otherwise , that little girl would n't have the aspect of her , and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk> .
Over time , they were lucky enough , and they needed more photos , so he went into Facebook and LinkedIn and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help .
Within two weeks , it had 150 people to join us .
In July , in July , we mobilized , <unk> , a <unk> , neighbor town north of <unk> .
And once a week we use our scanner in the photographic photographic libraries that had installed , where people were going to reclaim their photos .
The time that I took it into <unk> is a different story , it depended on the <unk> of the photos .
It could mean an hour . It could mean weeks .
It could make months .
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much hand using how to guide the areas whose color and detail was n't destroyed .
It took a long time .
The water destroyed all these pictures , covered in bacteria , covered by bacteria , with algae , even with oil , all of that alongside the time , and I continue to <unk> , so I 'm going to <unk> it was a major part of the project .
We could n't play the picture unless it was clean , dry and had been <unk> by her owner .
We were lucky with the janitors .
We tell the guide of a remarkable neighbor .
It 's very easy to hurt even more photos already .
As one once <unk> , the leader of my group is like making tattoo .
You ca n't make mistakes .
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos .
He had started <unk> her , but she stopped realizing that it would be even more .
I also had <unk> .
Without them , the images of their husband and their own face would n't have been able to rebuild , we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and play the whole picture .
When I collected his pictures shared some of his story with us .
A few colleagues from her husband found the photos in a fire station in the rubble quite far from where they used to be home , but their colleagues would <unk> it .
The tsunami , her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave .
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk> .
Their little kids , not so small now , but their two children were at school , in different schools .
One of them was stuck in the water .
It took a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived .
The day I gave him his daughter the lower son 14 years old .
To her , despite all of this , those pictures were the best gift I could do , which he could go back , something that would remember the past day that was n't filmed by that March day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed .
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there hundreds of them , and they helped them to clean up more than 13,000 photographs , the vast majority of them -- the great majority of them went back to their own owners .
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped to bring it back to 90 percent of hundreds of photos , fully <unk> and <unk> photos .
During this time , we do n't really spend more than $ 1,000 in teams and materials , most ink ink .
We take pictures all the time .
A picture is a memory of somebody or something , a relationship , a loved one .
They are <unk> of our memories and stories , the last thing we would take , but the first thing we would go for .
This was about this project , to restore little pieces of humanity , to give someone their connection to the past .
When a picture like this is coming back to somebody , it 's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it .
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk> .
Some of them connected with something bigger , to give back something , using their talent for something that 's not like perfect skin models .
Now , I 'd like to read this email . He sent him off the day that I came back from Japan after six months .
While <unk> , I could n't help but think about people and the stories shown in the images .
One particular one , a picture with <unk> women from the grandmother to the small little girl , gathering it around a baby , was moved , because a similar picture of my family my grandmother , my mother , me and my newborn daughter , hangs on our wall .
In the whole world , in all of our basic needs are the same , right ?
Thank you .
Now Doc <unk> inspired me awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that 's going through an apple in a single exposure of just one second .
But now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not for a million or a billion , but to a trillion of frames per second .
I give you a new kind of photograph : the <unk> -- a new technique that can create video in slow motion in motion .
And with that , we can create cameras that can see behind the corners , beyond the vision line , or look inside the body without using X-rays , and defy the camera idea .
If I take a laser pointer , and I turn it on and put it on a second <unk> <unk> , and it 's in a number of <unk> to create a package of <unk> photons in a millimeter .
And that <unk> pack , that bullet pack , travel to the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than a common bullet .
If we take that bullet and this <unk> pack and shoot in this bottle , how do you disperse those photons into this bottle ?
What 's the aspect of light in slow motion ?
Now , all this -- Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what takes to travel in the light .
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion .
Coca-Cola did n't make this research . They 're a lot of things in this film , and I put this information to show what 's going on .
The pulse , our bullet , goes into the bottle with a pack of photons that starts to go through and that , inside , start <unk> .
Part of the light is out of the light , goes to the table , and we started seeing these ripples .
A lot of the photons eventually come to the cap and then explode in several directions .
As you can see , there 's a bubble of air that 's bouncing inside the inside .
And at that time , the waves travel down the table , and because of the reflections of the top , it looks at the bottom of the bottle , after several boxes , which thoughts are concentrated .
Now , if we take a common and current bullet and we make it go the same distance , and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times , how much do you think it would take us to see that film ?
One day ? A week ? Actually , every year .
It would be a very boring film of a moving bullet movement .
And what about proving nature 's dead ?
You can see the waves coming out of the table , the tomato and the wall of the wall .
It 's like throwing a rock on a pond .
It 's the way that nature paints a picture , I thought , from a <unk> at the time , but of course our eyes see an integral composition .
But if you look at this tomato , you 'll notice that as the light gets over the tomato , it 's still bright . It 's not <unk> .
Why ? Because the tomato is ripe and the light bounces away inside it , and it comes back to a number of <unk> of a second .
In the future , when this <unk> is on your cell phones , you 're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it .
What do we create this camera at MIT ?
Like photographers , you know , if we take a picture of low exposure , it comes in very little light .
But we 're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest expo , so I just get into some light .
We sent out that bullet , that package of photons , millions of times , and we recorded over and again with a <unk> timing , we take those gigabytes of data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you .
We can take all these raw data and <unk> it in interesting ways .
Superman can fly .
Other heroes can become invisible .
And if a new power of a superhero future would allow him to see him after the corners ?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door . <unk> , entering the room , one part is going to reflect on the door , and from there to the camera .
Where we could get those multiple <unk> of light .
It 's not science fiction . We 've already built it .
On the left , it 's our <unk> .
Behind the wall is a dummy , and it <unk> the light on the door .
After the publication of our article in Nature Communications .
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera , but interestingly , slightly different times .
And as we have a camera that works so fast , our <unk> , it has unique capabilities .
It has very good temporary resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects , but we do n't know what extent it corresponds to .
When you project a laser , you can record a photo photo , which , you see on the screen , it does n't really make sense .
But we 'll take a lot of images like this , dozens of images , we 'll get them and we 're going to try to analyze the multiple light bounces , and with that , we can see the hidden object ?
Can we see it in 3D ?
This is our reconstruction .
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab , but in the future , we could create cars that can avoid collisions with what 's going around the curve .
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light reflected in open windows .
Or we could build <unk> able to see the interior of the body through <unk> , and the same for <unk> .
But of course , because of the fabric and the blood , this is quite difficult , so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualizing the problems that we can solve in the next generation in the next generation .
So as Doc <unk> , he himself a scientist , he became science in art , an art of <unk> photographs .
I realized that all of the gigabytes of data that we collected every time are not just for scientific visualizations , but we can .
I create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and code code .
And let 's look at those waves . Remember , the time between each of those waves is just a few second <unk> .
But here also happens something fun .
If you look at the waves underneath the cap , you go away from us .
The waves should move towards us .
What happens here ?
It turns out , as we 're recording almost at the speed of light , we have strange effects . Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
The order in which events happen in the world sometimes appears in the camera .
It <unk> the corresponding warping of space and time , we can correct this distortion .
It 's time . Thank you .
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
A mobile phone can change life , and it gives you an individual freedom .
With a cell phone , you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria .
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt .
With a mobile phone you can record a song , moving it to <unk> and become famous .
This is all possible with a mobile phone .
I 'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of Berlin .
Let 's go back to that moment , to this city .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were protesting for a change .
This is the fall of 1989 , and imagine if all of these people gathered in search for a change , they had a cell phone in your pocket .
Who obviously has a mobile phone here ?
<unk> .
Raise your cell phones , <unk> !
<unk> . A Android , a Blackberry , wow .
It 's a lot . Almost everyone is mobile .
But today I 'm going to talk about me , my mobile phone , and how I changed life .
I 'm going to talk about this .
These are 35 <unk> of information .
raw data .
Why is that information there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the E.U in the E.U . filed a directive .
The <unk> of <unk> .
This directive says that every European telephone company , every single Internet provider of all of Europe , has to store a whole range of users of users .
Who calls who . Who sends an email to who .
Who sends a text to who .
And if we use the mobile phone , where we are .
All this information is stored for at least six months , and even two years old , in his phone company or its Internet provider .
And throughout Europe , people stood up and said , `` We do n't want this . ''
They said they did n't want this retention .
We want the self-determination in the digital age , and we do n't want the phone carriers and the Internet providers , and the whole information about us .
There were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said , `` We do n't want this . ''
And here you can see about 10,000 people that came out to the streets in Berlin , and they said , `` freedom , not fear . ''
And some even said this would be Dr. 2.0 .
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany .
And I also wondered whether this works .
Can you store all this information about us ?
Any time I use mobile phone ?
So I asked my phone phone , <unk> <unk> , who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany , that please get all the information they had about me .
I asked them once , and I came back to ask , and I did n't get a particular answer . It was all blah , blah .
But then I said , `` I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life .
So I decided to give you a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information .
But <unk> <unk> said no , we wo n't give you this information .
Ultimately , we signed an agreement .
They <unk> the demand and they would send me the information that I would ask .
Meanwhile , the German <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U .
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside .
And in the CD there was this .
Thirty and 5,000 <unk> , 30 lines of information .
At first I saw them , and I said , well , it 's a huge archive . Okay .
But after a while I realized that it 's my life .
There are six months of my life on this file .
It was a bit skeptical : what should I do with that ?
Because you can see where I am , where I step at night , what I 'm doing .
But then I said , I want this information to go out .
I want to make it public .
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means .
So , next to <unk> Online and Open Data , we did this .
This is a visualization of six months of my life .
You can zoom in and zoom out , go backwards and forwards .
You can see every step I give .
And you can look at how I 'm going to train them on the train , and what often I call it on the journey .
This is all possible with this information .
That 's a little bit of fear .
But it 's not just about me .
It 's all of us .
First , there are things like , I call my wife and she calls me , we talked a couple of times .
Then they call me a few friends and they 're called each other .
And then you call each other , and the other one another , and we ended up with this big network of communications .
You can see how they communicate with each other to what time they call each other , what time they are to sleep .
You can see this all .
You can see the centers , the leaders of the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what society is doing .
If you have access to this information , you can control your society .
This is a model for countries like China and Iran .
This is a model to study the shape of your society , because you know who 's talking about who , who 's an email to who , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe , to two years .
As I said at the beginning , imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin , in the fall of 1989 , they had a cell phone in your pocket .
And the <unk> would have known who was involved in this protest , and if I had known it , I had known who leaders , this would never have happened .
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened .
And , in a result , neither of the <unk> <unk> .
Because now state agencies and companies want to store as much information of us as possible in and out of the web .
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to <unk> them forever .
But self-determination and living in the digital age is not a contradiction .
But today you have to fight for the self-determination .
You have to fight for that every day .
When you go home to tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century value , and it 's not going to be outmoded .
When you go home , tell your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information , they do n't have to .
And if you do n't believe me , ask your phone company , what information store from you .
So in the future , every time you use your mobile phones to remember that they have to fight for the self-determination era .
Thank you .
Hello TEDWomen , what happens ?
It 's not enough .
Hello TEDWomen , what happens ?
I call myself <unk> <unk> , and I 'm not <unk> , but I know the doctor who brought me to the world .
Let 's go back to my mom six times in six different directions , <unk> the poor of me in the process .
As a result , I have cerebral palsy , that 's why I 'm going to spend all the time .
Look .
It 's exhausting .
And Muhammad .
There 's not genetics .
It 's not <unk> , it can not contract .
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were siblings , although they are .
It 's just about accidents , like the one I came at birth .
Now I warn you , I 'm not a source of inspiration .
They feel bad for me , because at some point of life , I wish to be disabled .
Go on a walk .
<unk> Christmas , they 're in the mall , they 're driving in circles in search of parking spaces , and what do you see ?
16 empty places .
And they think , `` God , can I be at least a little disabled ? ''
Also , I 'm going to tell you , I 've got 99 problems , and your seat is just one of them .
There 's to be a <unk> of oppression , I would win the gold medal .
I 'm Palestinian , Muslim , woman , disabled , living in New Jersey .
If you do n't feel better , you might be able to do it .
I 'm from Rat Park , New Jersey .
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same first .
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York , I could .
Many people with cerebral palsy do n't walk , but my parents do n't believe in the `` ca n't . ''
The mantra of my father was , `` You can have [ cannon ] to do it ; I dance <unk> . ''
If my three <unk> sisters , I <unk> .
If my three older sisters were going to public school , my parents went to the school system , and they were <unk> that I would also be , and if we did n't pull out every single note of my mother , all of my mother was going to do .
My father taught me how to walk the five years to put my feet on their feet and just walking .
Another tactics that I used was to hang out a dollar in front of me so that he was <unk> .
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong .
Yeah . The first day in the kindergarten walked like a boxing champion that a boxing champion .
Growing up , there was only six Arabs in my city , and they were all of the family .
Now there are 20 Arabs , and they 're still all of the family . I think no one realized that we were n't Italian .
This was before 9/11 , and the politicians would think it 's appropriate to use `` I hate Muslims . ''
The people that I grew up with had no problems with my faith .
But nevertheless , it seemed to be a lot of starve to starve to starve .
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating , so <unk> at dusk is very easy .
I had covered on Broadway .
Yes , on Broadway . It 's crazy . My parents could n't afford physical therapy , so they sent me to dance school .
I learned to dance with heels , whatever I can walk on heels .
I 'm from New Jersey , and there we want to be <unk> , so if my women friends wear heels , I also .
And when my friends were going to spend the summer holiday on the Jersey coast , I was n't going .
I was going through my summers in a war zone , because my parents were afraid if we did n't go back to Palestine every summer , they become Madonna .
On the summer vacation , I 'm often trying to <unk> , so I was drinking milk of deer , so I was drinking milk of deer , put me hot cups on my back , and I remember the water burning the eyes and I thought , `` It works , it works . ''
But the miracle cure was yoga .
I should say it 's very boring , but before I do yoga , it was a comedian of stand-up I could n't wear [ booth ] .
And now I can <unk> in my head .
My parents gave this idea that I could do anything , that no dream was impossible , and my dream was to be at the General Hospital .
I went to college by positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the <unk> , University of the state of Arizona , because I was in all the <unk> .
It was like <unk> pet from the theater .
Everybody loved me .
I did all the <unk> tasks , I took out the maximum note in my classes , and also in their classes .
Every time I did a scene from the crystal zoo my professors wept .
But I never got a paper .
Finally , in my last year , the <unk> decided to do a piece called a very slow piece in Jackson .
It 's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy .
I was a girl with cerebral palsy .
So I started screaming at the four winds , `` Well , I 'll end up with a paper !
I have cerebral palsy !
<unk> ! The free end !
Thank God almighty , I 'm free ! ''
I did n't get the paper . They gave it to <unk> Brown .
I went to <unk> the principal of the theater theater , crying , as if someone had killed my cat , ask why , and she told me that they thought I could n't do the stunts .
And I said , `` Excuse me , if I ca n't do the risk stunts , neither can the character . ''
It was a role for the literally born and had an actress without cerebral palsy .
College was imitating my life .
Hollywood has a story of <unk> actors with disabled papers .
When I graduated from , I went home , and my first tour tour was just like a soap opera .
My dream was true .
And I knew it would be <unk> from `` mate '' to `` <unk> '' in a <unk> .
Instead , I stayed there like a vase , it did n't see me more than the neck , and it was apparent to me that the <unk> directors do n't <unk> actors , not white , disabled .
Just let people perfect .
But there were exceptions to the rule .
I grew up watching Goldberg <unk> , Roseanne <unk> , Ellen , and all these women had one thing in common -- they were comedians .
That 's why I became <unk> .
On my first tour , it took famous comics from New York to New Jersey , and I 'll never forget the face of the first comedy that I took when he fell into the realization that I was at the high speed of the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral palsy .
I worked in clubs across the United States , and also in Arabic in the Middle East , without censorship and <unk> .
Some people say I 'm the first <unk> of the Arab world .
I never like to reclaim the first place , but I know that they never heard that little nasty <unk> that says that women are not fun , and they 're really fun .
In 2003 , my brother 's brother and father , Dean <unk> , and I launched the New York Festival in New York City now in his <unk> year .
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic are not synonymous .
<unk> the Arabs were far easier than fighting the stigma challenge of disability .
My great opportunity came in 2010 .
I went as invited to the news program by the wire behind with Keith <unk> .
I went into a graduation dance , dragged me into a studio and they sat me in a wheelchair .
I looked at the principal and I said , `` Excuse me , can you give me a chair ? ''
She looked at me and said , `` Five , four , three , two ... ''
And we were live !
So I clinging to the host of the host to do n't go out on the screen during the segment , and when I finished the interview , he was pale .
I finally had my chance and the <unk> . I knew they would n't have me .
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to inviting me , but he was just like he was <unk> and bashed my chair .
Something that I learned directly with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are scum .
It 's said that kids are cruel , but they never did n't make fun of me or a child or older .
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became the object of ridicule .
I 'd see clips online with comments like , `` Why are you <unk> ? ''
`` Is it <unk> ? ''
And my favorite , `` Poor <unk> .
What disease does it have ?
We should really pray for it . ''
A commentator suggested even that I would add my rsum to my rsum : writer , comedian , paralyzed .
Disability is as visual as race .
If someone in a wheelchair ca n't do <unk> , then <unk> ca n't make someone in a wheelchair .
The disabled are the -- Yes , clap , man . Come on .
The disabled are the world 's largest minority in the world , and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment .
The doctors said not to walk , but I 'm here in front of you .
However , having grown up with media , I do n't think it was .
I hope that together we could create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life .
Maybe if there were more positive images , that would be less hate in the Internet .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children well .
My tortuous journey has taken me to very spectacular places .
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk> .
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my idol , the incredible Dave Matthews .
<unk> the world , `` Arabs have gone mad . ''
I was <unk> in the New Jersey state in New Jersey in 2008 .
And I founded `` <unk> <unk> , '' a charity to give the Palestinian refugee children a minuscule proportion of what my parents gave me .
It was the only time my father saw me live in live , and I 'm doing this talk to his memory .
<unk> , Dad .
I call myself <unk> <unk> , and if I can , you can also .
I 'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small village .
I do n't know your name , but I know your story .
He lives in a small town to the South <unk> town .
This village is close to <unk> .
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and the edge of starvation .
Without it there , it goes to the big city , in this case , <unk> , Somalia capital .
When you get there , there 's no opportunity , there 's no job , no perspectives in the future .
He 's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk> .
After maybe a year , <unk> , nothing .
One day he was approaching a gentleman who offers him to lunch , after dinner , to breakfast .
He meets a dynamic group of people , which gives a break .
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes , money to send home , to their family .
They presented to a young man .
And then she 's home .
It starts a new life .
It has a life goal .
A beautiful day in <unk> , under a blue sky , bursts a bomb car .
That little boy from that small village with the great city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were in <unk> , a connected terrorist organization to al Qaeda .
So how did the story of a child in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk> ?
He was waiting .
I was waiting for an opportunity , hoping to start their future , waiting for a future perspective , and this was the first thing he got .
This was the first thing that he got out of what we call the wait period .
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world .
It 's the story of the marginalized , young urban urban young people who were <unk> riots in Johannesburg , <unk> riots in London , who search for something beyond the wait period .
For young people , the promise of the city , the great dream of the city is the one of the opportunity , of jobs , of well-being , but young people do n't participate in the prosperity of their cities .
It 's often youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment .
By 2030 , three of every five people who live in cities are less than 18 years old .
If we do n't include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do n't provide opportunities , the history of the waiting period , the door of access to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the history of cities 2.0 .
And in my hometown of birth , <unk> , 70 percent of the young people are unemployed .
70 percent do n't work , it does n't go to school .
They do n't do pretty much .
I went back last month , and I went to visit <unk> Hospital , the hospital where I was born .
I remember being in front of that hospital , and I remember thinking , `` What if I 'd never gone ? ''
And if I had seen me forced to be on that same , `` <unk> period ? ''
Would I have become a terrorist ?
I 'm not really sure the answer .
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to house some juvenile leaders at a business summit .
They went to about 90 juvenile leaders , <unk> .
We sat down and we had a brainstorming on the solutions to the great challenges facing the city .
One of the young people in the room was <unk> .
He went to college University , he graduated .
No job , no opportunity .
I remember when he told me , that because he was a graduate student , unemployed , frustrated , was the perfect white for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
They were looking for people like him .
But this story takes a different path .
In <unk> , the biggest obstacle to coming from point A to B is the streets .
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system , and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize .
<unk> saw an opportunity and I seized it .
He started a motorcycles company .
It started by <unk> motorcycles of local residents who normally could n't afford them .
I bought 10 bikes , with the help of her family and friends , and his dream is at some time expanding hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years .
Why is this story different ?
What makes this story different ?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity .
It 's the business spirit , and I think the business spirit may be the most powerful tool against the wait period .
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are searching for so desperately .
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
I want to talk to you about a young man who was attending one of my meetings , Mohamed <unk> , a florist .
I was helping me to train some of the young people at the summit of entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship .
In fact , it 's the first florist that <unk> has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until a Mohamed came , if you wanted flowers for your wedding , <unk> , we were sent from plastic from abroad .
If you gave somebody , `` When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? ''
For those who grew up during the civil war , the answer would be , `` Never . ''
So , Mohamed saw an opportunity .
It started a <unk> , <unk> company .
I created a farm outside of <unk> , and started to grow <unk> and <unk> , who said , could survive the hard weather of <unk> .
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings , creating gardens in the houses , and the city companies , and now it 's working in creating the first public park in <unk> in 22 years .
There are no public parks in <unk> .
It wants to create a space where families , young people can go together , and as he says , smell the <unk> roses .
By the way , he does n't cultivate roses , because they use a lot of water .
So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , the presence of Mohamed had a really deep impact on young people .
They had never thought about starting a business .
They had thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but their story , their innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that might be <unk> .
By the end of the day , they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city .
They have business solutions for local problems .
So , inspired young people and create a culture of business spirit is actually a big step , but young people need to be capital to make their own ideas .
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in development and set in their business .
<unk> young people with the resources that they need , <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation , and create <unk> for urban growth .
For me , business spirit is something more than starting a business .
It 's a social impact .
Mohamed is not just selling flowers .
I think it 's selling hope .
Its Peace Park , this is how it 's called , when it 's created , it will transform the way people see their city .
She hired kids from the street to help rent to rent and keep motorcycles for him .
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of the wait period .
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities .
So my suggestion is : to become young people in entrepreneurs , <unk> and feeding their inherent innovation , and they will have more stories about flowers and reserve that <unk> and `` Wait periods . ''
Thank you .
I was about ten years old , and I went camping with my dad in the <unk> mountains , a <unk> area north of New York City .
It was a beautiful day .
The <unk> forest .
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> , and it 's not going to be on the way that we were still , we can pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land .
We got to our camp .
It was a shed in a <unk> view of a beautiful lake when I discovered something horrible .
Behind the shed there was a dump , from about four square feet with <unk> rotten paper balls , aluminum investors .
And I was stunned , I was very angry and incredibly confused .
The <unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they had brought , who thought he was going to clean up their garbage ?
That question followed with me , and there 's a little simplified .
Who clean our garbage ?
No matter how to organize or where we <unk> our garbage , who clean our garbage in Istanbul ?
Who clean our garbage in the Rio or in Paris or in London ?
Here in New York , the Department of <unk> clean our garbage , and by 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day .
I wanted to know them as individuals .
I wanted to understand who does that work .
What does it feel to use the uniform and get that burden on ?
So I started a research project with them .
I traveled in the trucks and walked along the trajectory and I interviewed people in offices and I interviewed people in offices , and I learned a lot , but it was still a <unk> .
I needed to go into it more .
So I started working like <unk> .
I 'm not just traveling in the trucks . I did them .
And it operated the mechanical mechanical and bar snow .
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning .
They all ask about the smell .
It 's there , but it 's not as mainstream as you think , and in the days that it 's very strong you get used to it quickly .
It costs a lot of used to weight .
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies were kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week .
It 's also the danger .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the collection of waste is one of the ten <unk> <unk> in the country , and I learned the reason .
You 're coming out and moving into the traffic all day , and you 're humming around you .
They just want to <unk> , so in general the driver is not paying attention .
That 's very bad for the worker .
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage .
I also learned about the relentless of garbage .
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck , you get to understand that the crap is like a force of nature itself .
It never stops coming .
It 's also like a shape of breathing or circulation .
It should always be in motion .
And it 's also the stigma .
It seems to me that the stigma is particularly ironic because I think it 's <unk> , because it 's the most important workforce in the streets of the city , for three reasons .
They 're the first protective of public health protection .
If you do n't get rid of the efficient , efficient , effective way , this begins to <unk> out of its container and its dangers inherent threaten us in very real ways .
So we had been controlled for decades and centuries and they start <unk> .
The economy needs them .
If we ca n't get rid of the old , we do n't have space for the new so that the engines of economics start to fail when it 's in danger .
I 'm not advocating for capitalism , just to point out its relationship .
And then there 's what I call our average average speed you need .
So , I mean , I mean just the speed that we used to move in contemporary time .
We usually do n't care , and we do n't know we do n't know , we do n't know , we do n't know , we did n't know , our cup of coffee , our bag of <unk> , our water bottle .
We use them , we throw them , we forget about them , because we know that there 's a job force on the other side that we can take of it .
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that might help reduce stigma and <unk> into that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city .
Her job , I think , is almost <unk> .
They 're on the street every day , <unk> .
They use a uniform in many cities .
You know when you 're going .
And their job allows us to do our own .
They 're almost a form of relief .
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves , of our own waste , our junk , and that flow should always stay in one way or another .
On the 11th of September 11th , 2001 , I heard about a <unk> truck on the street , I grabbed my little kid , and I went down the stairs running , and there was a man doing his journey of <unk> , like I did all on Wednesday .
And I tried to thank him for doing his job that particular day , but I started to cry .
And he looked at me and just nodded , and he said , `` We 're going to be fine .
We 're going to be okay . ''
Shortly after that I started looking at the garbage collection and I came back to see that man .
It 's called <unk> , and we work together a lot of times , and we made good friends .
I want to believe that I was right .
We 're going to be okay .
But in our efforts to rebuild the way we exist in this planet as a species we have to include and have in account every cost , even the very real human cost of labor .
The city waste , what we think when we talk about garbage , represent three percent of the nation 's waste .
It 's a remarkable statistic .
So in the flow of your day and your life , the next one to see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you , take a moment to recognize them .
Just take a moment to say thank you .
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our communal lives being part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the local conditions and traditions .
And I brought two recent projects today as an example of this .
Both projects are located in emerging countries , one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia .
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture .
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in Ethiopia 's capital , Addis Ababa .
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example , my team and me , about what we had to design .
At first , the first thing I thought was , `` I want to run out . ''
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city , we realized that there are three important aspects to point out .
In principle , these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people ca n't afford to buy things .
Second , you need to use much energy because the skin with crystals generates heat inside , so it 's necessary for a lot of cooling .
In a city where this should n't happen because it 's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year .
And third , it looks like nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia .
It 's a pity for a place so rich in culture and traditions .
In our first visit to Ethiopia , I was really engaged with the old market , which is this <unk> structure where thousands of people , go and buy things every day to little marketers .
There 's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity .
So I thought , that was what I really wanted to design , not a mall .
But the question was how to build a modern building , <unk> , applying these principles .
The next challenge was presented to the survey the site , which is located in a very much area of the city growth , where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image , not exist .
And also there is between two parallel streets that do n't communicate at an extension of hundreds of meters .
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets , linking all the entries from the building .
And this extends with an tilted atrium , which creates a space to the open air in the building that <unk> , for its own shape of the sun and the rain .
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses , which changes in every floor because of the form of space .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
I wanted to find a solution to respond to the local weather conditions .
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a <unk> concrete shell to allow the air to the air , and also the light , but in a filtered shape .
And then we get inspired by these beautiful buttons in Ethiopians in Ethiopians .
They have the properties of fractal geometry , and it helped me model the facade .
We 're building that with these tiny pieces , which are the windows that let happen the air and light in a controlled way inside the building .
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night .
With these ideas , it was n't easy to convince developers , because they thought , `` That 's not a mall . It was n't what we ask . ''
But ultimately , we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the business center , because at the end of the day there were more local to sell .
And also the idea of the facade was so much cheaper , not only because of the material compared to glass , but also because it was no longer necessary to keep air conditioning .
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project .
The first thing was to think about how to get the <unk> of energy to the building in a city where electricity is almost every day .
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof .
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis .
And these <unk> on top of the roof , which collect water for the inner health .
The next year is expected for the next year , because we go through the fifth floor of construction .
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia .
And to make such a big project , the greatest thing I 've designed , I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia , but also to their environment , its tradition and culture .
During that analysis , I put special attention to the <unk> , a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 doors of access connected by fairly straight lines .
When I went to the place , the first design operation that we did was we expand existing streets , creating 12 , ancient blocks of size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards .
In addition to that , we pick some strategic dots in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines , and this has altered the initial model .
And the last operation was to think of the cell , the little cell in the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
I thought , what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the Mediterranean climate ?
And it 's direct , because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation .
So let 's take a schematic that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction .
And this is the result that 's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city .
It has these blocks with courtyards , and then in the floor , we have all the connections for pedestrians .
And it also responds to local norms that make a higher density at higher levels and lower density in the ground floor .
And it also reinforces this idea of doors .
The roof , which is my favorite space of the project , almost as giving up the community , the occupied space is about construction .
It 's where all of the neighbors can go up and go up and socialize , and doing activities like running a race of two kilometers in the morning , or to jump from one building to another .
These two examples , they have a common approach to design process .
And also , they 're in emerging countries , where you can see the cities literally growing .
In these cities , the impact of architecture in people 's lives changes the local communities and local economies at the same pace that the buildings grow .
For this reason , I see even more important to look at simple solutions looking for simple solutions , but affordable , that improve the relationship between community and environment , and they have as objective connecting nature to people .
Thank you very much .
When I was eight , a new girl joined our class . It was so remarkable , as you see all the new girls .
He had huge amounts of hair very bright , and a little <unk> , cute pencils , he was super strong for the capitals of the states , very good for <unk> .
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy , until I <unk> my sinister plan .
I stood in a time after the school exit . It was a little afternoon and I hid in the girls ' bathroom .
When the coast was <unk> , I came out in the classroom , I took off the table of my master 's table .
And then I did .
I <unk> the ratings of my rival , just a little bit , just a few .
All the way . And I set up to give back the book to the drawer and , but to see , some of my other colleagues had very good grades as well .
So , in a frenzy , <unk> notes around the world , without any imagination .
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row like this , just to be there , because I could ...
I still wonder what I did .
I do n't understand how the idea arose .
I do n't understand why I was fine doing it .
I felt important .
I do n't understand why I never caught myself .
It 's all very obvious .
I never figured out .
But most of all , I 'm going to tell you why I was bothered by this little girl , so small , it was so good at <unk> .
<unk> jealousy .
They 're so mysterious and so <unk> .
We know that babies suffer from jealousy .
Also primates . <unk> are very likely .
We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spouse in the United States .
And yet I 've never seen a study that observe loneliness , or the long duration or the sadness .
And so , you have to go to fiction , because novels are like the lab where you study jealousy in all of its possible forms .
In fact , I do n't know if it 's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy , <unk> would have neither literature .
Well , there was no <unk> , there was no <unk> .
There would be no king <unk> , `` <unk> and a nights . ''
There was no Shakespeare .
<unk> the reading lists of high school , because we would be losing `` The Noise and the <unk> '' -- there would be `` Gatsby '' and `` Party . '' We will lose `` Madame <unk> '' and `` Anna K . ''
Without jealousy , there is no Proust . I know it 's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything , and in terms of jealousy , most of them have .
This year was being spent 100 years of their masterpiece , `` searches for time , '' the most comprehensive study of sexual jealousy and also the ordinary competitiveness , my own , everything we might have , and thinking about Proust , we have the details that are <unk> , right ?
We think in a child trying to reconcile sleep .
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
We forgot how hard that image is .
We forgot about how relentless it is .
I mean , it 's books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat .
I do n't know what the cat <unk> is , but we assume it 's <unk> .
Let 's see why they go so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy and Proust .
It will be very obvious as jealousy , who get reduced to the person , their desire , to their impediments , are a very solid basis ?
I do n't know . I think we got very close to the bone , when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy .
When we feel jealousy , we tell ourselves a story .
A story about other people 's lives , and those stories make us feel terrible because they 're designed for that , to make us feel bad .
Being storytellers and audience , we know exactly how little details to include , to nail the knife , right ?
<unk> make us all amateurs , and that 's something that Proust understood .
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure , maybe right now . ''
And it starts to say to you that story , and since then , Proust says that every fresh charm that <unk> senses in his lover , adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera .
You have to admit that you 're going to be honest and Proust , it was notoriously jealous .
You know , Proust should have to leave the country , if they wanted to break it .
But you do n't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it 's a tough job . Right ?
<unk> are <unk> .
It 's a hungry emotion . You need to power it .
How are jealousy ?
jealousy will get rid of information .
<unk> use details .
<unk> like big amounts of hair and the cute little <unk> of pencils .
<unk> <unk> from the photos .
That 's why Instagram is so successful , Proust links well the <unk> language with the jealousy .
When <unk> is in the agony of jealousy , suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> the servants of his lover , then defends those behaviors .
He says , `` Look , I know you think this is revolting , but it 's not different from the interpretation of an old text or to look at a memorial . ''
He says , `` These are scientific research with real intellectual value . ''
Proust is trying to show that the jealousy look <unk> , and they make us seem <unk> , but at its point , they 're finding out of knowledge , search for truth , really painful . In fact , what Proust matters , the more painful the truth , the better .
The pain , humiliation , loss : These were the pathways towards Proust wisdom .
He says , `` A woman who we need , that makes us suffer , it causes us a range of feelings , much more profound and vital feelings that a wise man can be interested in . ''
Is it telling us that we 're going to look for cruel women ?
No . I think it 's trying to say that jealousy , they reveal us .
And there 's some other emotion that makes us open ourselves in this particular way ?
Is there any other emotion that we reveals our <unk> , our horrible ambition and our rights ?
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so peculiar ?
Freud would write about this later .
One day , Freud was visited by a very nervous woman who was consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk> him .
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man , who did n't get into what his wife did .
Because she was innocent ; everybody knew it .
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause .
But he was looking for things that his wife did , without realizing , <unk> behaviors .
Is it too much <unk> ?
Freud says that man was becoming the unconscious of his wife 's unconscious .
The novels are very good at this .
The novels described very well how jealousy they make us look at intensity , but without precision .
In fact , the more intensely , the more we are , we become more residents in fantasy .
And for this reason , I believe , jealousy , lead us to do violent acts or illegal acts .
jealousy drives us to behave in a totally <unk> ways .
Now I 'm thinking about the eight years , I recognize it . But I 'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news .
A woman of Michigan , of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake on Facebook account since they were texting <unk> , horrible self for a year .
For one year . A year .
She was trying to <unk> her former boyfriend , and I have to confess , when or this , I reacted with admiration .
Because we 're realistic .
What huge , even unfortunate , creativity . Right ?
It 's like novel .
Like a <unk> <unk> novel .
<unk> is one of my favorites .
She 's a very strange and brilliant character in the American literature .
It 's the author of `` <unk> in a <unk> '' and `` The <unk> Mr. <unk> , '' and `` The <unk> Mr. <unk> , '' and once we are in the sphere , in the realm of jealousy , the membrane that separates what is what it might be , can be rewarded in a moment .
Take Tom <unk> , his most famous character .
Tom <unk> is going to <unk> or want what you 've got to invade your own and <unk> what you 've ever got , and it 's under the floor . <unk> your rings , you take your rings , you cast your bank accounts .
It 's a way .
But what do we do ? We ca n't take the route of Tom <unk> .
I ca n't tell you all the world , as much as sometimes I want .
It 's a pity , because we live in times of envy .
We live in times of jealousy .
I mean , we 're good citizens of social media citizens , where about currency is envy ? Right ?
The novels show us the way ? I 'm not sure .
So let 's do what characters always do when they 're not safe , when they 're in front of a mystery .
Let 's go to Baker Street , and ask for <unk> mosquitos .
When people think educated , they think about the <unk> curse in Professor Moriarty , that criminal genius .
But I 've always ever preferred [ at <unk> ] <unk> , the head of rat <unk> 's head of <unk> , which needs desperately desperately to need Holmes 's genius , but it 's annoyed .
Oh , it sounds so familiar .
<unk> needs its help , but <unk> it , and <unk> with bitterness , one of the mysteries .
But as they work together , something starts to change , and finally in `` The <unk> of the Six <unk> , '' once deforestation comes into , <unk> all of his solution , <unk> comes back to bruises and says , `` We 're not jealous , sir educated .
We 're proud of you . ''
And it tells you that there 's no person in <unk> <unk> that I do n't want to shake your hand .
It 's one of the times that we see ape transferred to the story . I think this is very emotional . That scene is also mysterious , right ?
It looks like treating jealousy as a geometry problem , without emotion .
You know , in a minute celebrating the opposite side of <unk> .
The next minute , they 're on the same side .
Suddenly , <unk> , you can admire that idea of being the <unk> .
Could it be so simple ?
What if jealousy are really a matter of geometry , just a question of where we allow us to be relative to the other ?
Well , maybe we do n't have to get rid of the excellence of the other .
We can <unk> with it .
But I like the contingency plan .
So while we hope that , we remember that we have the fiction to <unk> .
Only fiction <unk> jealousy .
The fiction used the <unk> , invites them to the table .
And look at what <unk> : sweet <unk> , the scary Tom <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the Marcel Proust .
We 're in excellent company .
Thank you .
We used to solve big problems .
On the 21 of July , of 1969 , Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of the Apollo 11 of Apollo 11 and descended on the <unk> Sea .
Armstrong and Harry were alone , but the presence of the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process .
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization in peace times in American history .
To get to the moon , NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today , or four percent of the federal budget .
The Apollo led to about 400,000 people , and asked about 20,000 businesses , universities and government agencies .
People died , including the Apollo 1 .
But before the Apollo <unk> program , 24 men traveled to the moon .
Twelve walked on his surface , of which I stayed on the surface of Armstrong last year , is now the most old man .
So , why did they go ?
They did n't brought much back : <unk> kilos of old rocks , and something that 24 <unk> later , a new sense of a sense of a sense and fragility of our common home .
Why were they ? The cynical answer is that they were because the Kennedy President wanted to prove to the Soviets , that this nation had better rockets .
But the <unk> words at Rice University in 1962 gives us a better idea .
John F. Kennedy : Some people ask , why the moon ?
Why turn it into our target ?
And you might also ask , why is climbing the highest mountain ?
Thirty-five years ago , why would fly over the Atlantic ?
Why do they play Rice versus Texas ?
We choose to go to the moon .
We choose to go to the moon .
We choose to go to the moon in this decade , and do other things , not because they 're simple , but because they 're hard .
Jason <unk> : For the contemporaries , Apollo was not just a victory of the West above the east in the Cold War .
At the time , the strongest emotion was to wonder with the transcendence of the technology of technology .
It was because it was great to be able to do it .
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technological outcomes .
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane , the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis .
In the middle of the century , the polio <unk> was eliminated , and we eliminated the smallpox .
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called `` <unk> force . ''
For most of the history of mankind , we could n't go faster than a horse , or a sailing boat , but in 1969 , the Apollo 10 flew 40 miles / hour .
Since 1970 , no human being has gone back to the moon .
Nobody has traveled faster than Apollo 10 , and the optimism of the power of Apollo 10 , and the optimism of the power of the technology has to be able to go to Mars , create a clean energy , cure cancer , or feeding the world population seem to be a few more intractable result .
I remember the Apollo 17 <unk> .
I was five years old , and my mother told me they did n't look at the <unk> tube <unk> of the rocket Saturn .
I knew <unk> that this would be the last <unk> mission , but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars .
So that 's what happened to our ability to solve problems with technology , has become a common place .
We hear it all the time .
We 've heard it for the last two days here , at TED .
It looks like the technologists , if we were technologists , and they have enriched with trivial toys , things like iPhones , and social networks , and social networks , or algorithms that speed up the automated selling .
There 's nothing wrong with most of these things .
They have expanded and enriched our lives .
But they do n't address the big problems of humanity .
What happened ?
There 's a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley , which is that they 've been created less ambitious companies than the ones in which I 've been doing , Microsoft , Apple and <unk> .
Silicon Valley says that markets are guilty , concrete , incentives that risk capitalists offer business .
Silicon Valley says the risk of risk caused it to change the creation of ideas by having incremental problems , or even false problems .
But I do n't think this is good enough .
It 's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley .
Even when capitalists venture capitalists were at their peak without worrying about risk , small investments , small investments that they could go out in 10 years .
<unk> . They 've always had trouble to invest with profit in technologies like energy , that they need a huge capital and the development of development , they have never invested in development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they do n't have a immediate commercial value .
No , the reasons why we ca n't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound .
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems .
We could go to Mars if we want .
NASA has even designed a plan .
But going to Mars , it would require a political decision that was popular , and that will never happen .
We wo n't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth .
Sometimes , we ca n't solve the big problems because political systems fail .
Today , less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy , the wind and wind and <unk> -- and it 's absolutely economic .
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind , and oil is cheaper than the <unk> .
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at price . They do n't exist .
Now , technologists , the entrepreneurs and the economists agree about what policies and international treaties as well as the development of an alternative energy : mostly , a significant increase in research and energy development , and some kind of <unk> control .
But there is no hope in the political climate that we 're going to see an energy policy of the U.S. or treaties that reflect that consensus .
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological , it turns out not to be .
We know that famines are a result of failure for failure .
But 30 years of research have taught us that hunger are political crises that affect the distribution of food .
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and food route , but there will be famine while there were bad governments .
Finally , the big problems sometimes we 're going to make a solution because we do n't understand the problem .
President Nixon declared the cancer in 1971 , but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer , some <unk> resistant to treatment , and only in the last 10 years , they seem to have been found effective treatments and viable treatments .
The hard problems are difficult .
It 's not true that we could n't solve problems with technology .
We can , and we must , but these four elements of being present : the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem , the institutions must support the solution ; it should really be a technological problem , and we need to understand it .
The Apollo mission , which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems , it meets those criteria .
But it 's a <unk> model in the future .
We 're not in 1961 .
There 's no <unk> competition like in the Cold War , there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> hard and dangerous , and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system .
In general , going to the moon , the moon turned out to be simple .
It was just three days .
And I really did n't even address any problem .
We are alone in our present , and the solutions of the future will be harder to get .
God knows we do n't miss the challenges .
Thank you very much .
Well , I 'm going to talk about trust , and I 'm going to begin with <unk> ideas that have about trust .
They 're so common that they have become <unk> of our society .
I think it 's three .
The first is a claim : there have been a huge decline of trust , is a very general belief .
The second is a goal : we should have more confidence .
And the third is a task : we should be able to recover trust .
I think the claim , the goal and the task has been wrong .
What I 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , a goal and a task , which I think gives you a more clear idea about it .
First of the claim , why do people think that trust has declined ?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence , I do n't know the answer .
I bow to think that it may have been decreased in some activities or institutions and there might be augmented in others .
I 'm not sure .
But I can turn to opinion surveys , and polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has declined .
When you look at opinion polls over time , there 's no evidence of it .
I mean , the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago , mostly journalists and politicians , continue to inspire the same distrust .
And the people who were very confident about 20 years ago are still quite reliable , judges , nurses .
The rest of us are in the middle , and by the way , the average citizen on the street is almost exactly halfway .
But is this evidence ?
What they 're looking at is , of course , opinions .
What else can you register ?
What you look at is generic attitudes that people do when they ask some questions .
Trust the politicians ? Trust the teachers ?
Now , if somebody asked you , `` Did you look at the <unk> ?
<unk> in the fishermen ?
<unk> in elementary teachers ? ''
I probably asked you to ask , `` To do what ? ''
And that would be a very sane response .
And you could say , when you say , when you say , `` Well , I trust you in some , but in other people . ''
It 's very rational .
Ultimately , in real life , we tend to create distinct trust .
We do n't assume that the level of confidence we 're going to feel for a certain officer , official or type of person , will be uniform in all cases .
I could , for example , that I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the class of reading , but in no way to drive the school <unk> .
After all , I could know that it was n't a good driver .
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation , but not , maybe to keep a secret .
Simple .
What if we 've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is distinct , why do we leave all that knowledge when we think of trust in the most abstract form ?
I think that polls are very bad tools to measure the real confidence in real confidence , because they 're trying to attract the good judgment of the fact of trusting something or someone .
Secondly , what about the goal ?
The goal is to have more confidence .
Frankly , I think it 's a stupid goal .
It 's not the goal I 'm going to do .
I would agree to have more confidence in what is trusted , but not what it is .
Ultimately , I 'm keen not to trust what 's not reliable .
And I think that those people who were putting their savings with the very rightly called Mr. Madoff , who then disappeared with them , I think of them , and I think , well , they were too confident .
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life .
Confidence deposited or <unk> with intelligence , that 's the right goal .
Once you say it , it says , yes , it 's worth , that means what matters in the first place is not trust , but trustworthiness .
What it is about to make a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways .
And I think that we can make a trial , we are forced to focus on three things .
Are they competent ? Are they honest ? Are they responsible ?
And if we find that one person is competent in medicines , and it 's responsible and honest , then we 're going to have a very good reason to trust it , because it 's going to be worthy of trust .
But if , on the contrary , they 're not responsible , we could n't trust them .
I have friends who are competent and honest , but I did n't trusted them to get a letter to the mail because they 're <unk> .
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things , but I see that they 're going to do it .
And I 'm very pleased to say that I do n't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely <unk> .
If this is , I did n't realize yet .
But that 's what we 're looking for : trustworthiness , before we trust .
Trust is the answer .
The trustworthiness is what we need to judge .
And of course , it 's hard .
Over the last few decades , we 've been trying to build accountability of accountability for all sorts of institutions , professionals , people and others , who make us easier the task to judge their reliability .
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect .
They do n't work as they should .
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> , and he said , `` Well , you see , the problem is that it takes longer to make the administrative paperwork that can attend to . ''
And we found the same problem in our own public and institutional life , that the accountability of accountability that is destined to guarantee , and the evidence of trustworthiness , it 's actually doing the opposite .
What they do is they make it difficult to do the work of people who have to do hard tasks , like the midwives , <unk> that `` <unk> boxes , '' as we say .
I 'm sure you all know similar examples .
All of that , for the goal .
I think that the goal should be more trustworthiness , and that things would be different if we 're going to be worthy of trust and <unk> the people that we are confident and if we 're trying to determine whether other people , people or politicians are worthy of trust .
It 's not easy . It 's the judgment , simple actions , attitudes , which do n't do properly .
Third , the task .
You get the task to rebuild the trust , you put things upside down .
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust .
Well , we can do it with ourselves .
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness .
We can do it if they 're two people , together , trying to improve trust .
But trust , ultimately , is distinctive because they give us other people .
You ca n't rebuild what other people have given you .
You 've got to give them enough bases for you to trust you .
You have to be worthy of trust .
And that , of course , is because you ca n't trick , usually , all the people , all the time .
But you should also be able to take a <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust .
How do you do that ?
That 's done every day , everywhere , the ordinary people do , the people , the institutions , very effectively .
I 'll give you a simple business example .
The store where I buy my socks on my socks , I can shake them back without giving .
I 'm wearing them and turn it back , or change the color of the color I want .
That 's great . I trust them because they became vulnerable to me .
I think there 's a big lesson on that .
If you become vulnerable to the other part , that 's a very good proof of trust , and you have confidence in what you 're saying .
So , at the end , I think what we 're aiming at is not a very difficult thing to figure out .
What people rely on is in relationships , and in that framework , they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust .
Thank you .
From the early computers , we 've been working on the beginning of separation between us and digital information , the separation between our material world and the world on the screen that the imagination can be destroyed .
This separation has been reducing , increasingly , and more , to the point that today is less than one millimeter , the thickness of a glass screen , and the power of computing has become accessible to everybody .
But I wonder , and if there were no barriers ?
I started imagining what it would be .
First of all , this tool that goes into digital space , so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is <unk> its body physical body physical body .
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D , and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen .
So , with this tool , the booms break down .
But the two hands remain still outside the screen .
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands ?
In the Science division of Microsoft , along with my mentor <unk> <unk> , <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital field of work .
So I combined a <unk> bombsight with depth cameras to detect your fingers and your face , you can now raise your hands of the keyboard , get into the inside space , and grab pixels directly with your hands .
As the windows and archives have a location in real space , <unk> it 's as easy as taking a shelf on a shelf .
You can flip through the book , and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that 's down there on every floating screen .
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands .
In these examples , we 're feeding in the digital world .
And if we invest the papers and make the digital information come towards us ?
Surely , a lot of us will be bought and <unk> things online .
Now that does n't have to worry .
What I have here is a virtual <unk> online .
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system involves the geometry of your body .
If we take this idea further , I thought , instead of just seeing pixels in space , how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel them ?
How would a future look like that ?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii and my <unk> Post , we created this only physical pixel .
This spherical magnet behaves like a 3D pixel in the space , which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere into this small three-dimensional space .
<unk> , what we did was we ring gravity and control movement through a combination of levitation , mechanical <unk> and detectors .
And by programming the object , we gave it away from the constraints of time and space , which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and stay in the physical world .
You can teach physically physically , and at a distance , and you 're famous for Michael Jordan , you can reproduce it as a physical reality , the times we wanted .
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets , the physics , and unlike the monitors , or textbooks , this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel . It 's very powerful .
But what 's more fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world to change our everyday physical activities .
As you can see , digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act on us as part of the physical world around us without us with us with the <unk> of our world .
We started talking about a barrier today , but if we discount that barrier , the only limit that remains is our imagination .
Thank you .
I <unk> to become a female for two years in <unk> , China , in the 1970s .
When I was in first grade , the government wanted to take a school to athletes at all expenses .
But my tiger mother said , `` No . ''
My parents wanted me to become engineering , like them .
After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they believed that there was only an accurate path toward happiness : a safe and good job .
No matter what if I would like to do n't .
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer .
This was me , on my imaginary piano .
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young men to learn the stunts , so I tried everything I could get to the opera school .
I even wrote the school director and the host of a radio show .
But no adult will tell you the idea .
No adult took me seriously .
Only my friends supported me , but they were children , without authority , like me .
So at the age of 15 , I knew it was too much bigger to train .
My dream will never happen .
I was afraid , that during the rest of my life , a second class happiness would be the only thing I aspire to .
And this was so unfair .
So I solved looking for another calling .
Anybody around me wanted to teach me ? OK .
He <unk> books .
[ `` Text <unk> '' <unk> <unk> ) [ `` <unk> <unk> '' ] [ `` <unk> of History '' ] So I got to America in 1995 , and what were the first books that I read here ?
Those were banned in China , of course .
`` Good Earth '' is about Chinese Chinese life .
And it 's not propaganda convenient . <unk> .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
That 's a topic for another day .
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation , `` <unk> your father and your mother . ''
`` <unk> , '' I said , `` It 's so different , and much better than going to obey . ''
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> , and to reset the relationship with my parents .
The meeting with a new culture gave up my comparative reading habit .
We have a lot of perspectives .
For example , this map seemed out of the place because this is what the students in China learning .
I had never occurred to me , that China did n't have to be in the center of the world .
A map involves the perspective of people .
<unk> reading is not new .
It 's a common practice in the academic world .
There are to research fields as comparative religion and comparative literature .
Compare and contrast , offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject .
And I thought , if comparative reading worked to research , why do n't you do that as well in everyday life ?
So I started reading books from two .
You can be a person , `` Benjamin Franklin , '' <unk> <unk> [ `` John Adams '' ] that were involved in a same event , or friends with shared experiences .
For the Christ , temptation are cheap , political and spiritual .
To the Buddha , they 're all psychological -- lust , fear and social duty -- Interesting .
If you know another language , it 's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .

For example , through translation that I realized that `` happiness '' in Chinese literally means `` joy . '' Ha !
And `` girlfriend '' in Chinese , literally means `` new mother . ''
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present .
I know I wo n't feel like I 'm feeling lonely or powerless .
Having a broken dream is really nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
I 've come to believe that fulfillment is not the only purpose of a dream .
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from , where the passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
Even a severe sleep can do that for you .
And it 's because of the books , which I 'm here , happy , living again with purpose and clearly , most of the time .
So the books will always join you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
When I was in my <unk> , I saw my first client of psychotherapy .
I was a Ph.D. student in the clinical psychology in Berkeley .
She was a <unk> woman called Alex .
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> , threw on the couch in my office and took off the shoes , and he told me that he wanted to talk about his problems with men .
When I heard this , I felt so relieved .
My class roommate had a <unk> as a first client .
And I got a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men .
I thought I could handle it .
But I did n't .
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions , it made me easy just to move the head while I would make the solution .
`` <unk> , '' I said , Alex , and what I saw , she was right .
You start to work later , you 're home , you have kids later , to death happens afterwards .
By <unk> like Alex and I had time to stop .
But soon after , my supervisor 's <unk> pushed me to press Alex talking about their loving life .
I was resistant .
I said , `` Sure , he 's coming out with guys under his category , and he sits lying with a <unk> head , but it 's not like he was to marry him . ''
And then my supervisor said , `` No , no , but maybe you marry the next .
Also , the best time to work in Alex 's marriage is before they get married . ''
This is what psychologists call `` Aha ! ''
It was when I realized the '30s are not the new <unk> .
Yes , people sit in your head after what used to be used , but this did n't have the <unk> of Alex being a break in their development .
This made the <unk> of Alex was the perfect moment , and we were throwing it away .
And so I realized , this kind of negligence is a real problem , and it had real consequences , not just for Alex and his loved life , but for the careers , the families and future <unk> everywhere .
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today .
This means 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if they think that no one gets to age without spending before the <unk> .
Raise your hand if you 're in your <unk> .
I want to see the <unk> here .
Oh , yeah ! They 're amazing .
If they work with <unk> , they love a 20-year-old , they take your dream out of a 20-year-old , I want to see . Amazing , the <unk> really matter .
This is not just my opinion . These are the facts .
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years .
This means eight of each 10 decisions and experiences and moments , `` Aha ! '' that give you your life to have been past when you have 30 and so many .
People in more than 40 , I failed to panic .
This audience is going to be okay , I think .
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money they will win .
We know more than half of Americans are married , they live or dating their future partner at the age of 30 .
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for adulthood , which means that if there 's something that they want to change themselves , now it 's time to change it .
We know that personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any time of life , and we know that female fertility arrives at the top of the 28 , and things become complicated to the 35 .
<unk> are the moment to get educated on their body and their options .
When we think about the development of the child , we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain .
It 's a moment in which their daily and common life has an impact on the person who will become .
But what we do n't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development .
But this is not what the <unk> are listening .
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of age of time .
The researchers call them an extended adolescence .
The journalists would give dumb names to the <unk> like `` <unk> '' and `` <unk> . ''
It 's true .
As a culture , we 've considered a triviality what is actually the decade that defines as old as adults .
Leonard Bernstein said to make big things , you need a plan and not enough time .
Is n't it true ?
What do you think happens when you give a 20-year-old in your head , and you say , `` You have another 10 years to start your life ? ''
Nothing happens .
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition , and it 's absolutely nothing .
And then every day , smart educated , interesting ones like you or your children , and your children come to my office and say something like that , `` I know my boyfriend is n't good for me , but this relationship does n't count . I 'm just killing time . ''
Or they say , `` Everybody says , as you start a career before 30 , everything will be fine . ''
But then it starts to sound something like this : `` My <unk> are <unk> , and I still have nothing to show .
I had better copy the day I graduated from college . ''
And then he starts to sound something like this : `` My dating for the <unk> were like the chairs .
They were all running around and <unk> , but then at some point around the 1930s , the music went off and all began to sit .
I did n't want to be the only one who was hanging out , so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was 30 . ''
Where are the <unk> here ?
Do n't do that .
Well , that sounds a little bit extreme , but no mistake , the risks are very high .
When you leave a lot of things for the '30s , there 's a huge pressure on your 30s and so many of you start a career , pick a career , choose a city , pick a couple , and have two or three children in a much more short period of time .
Many of these things are not compatible , and there 's research that starts to show , which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to the 1930s .
The middle middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars .
It 's about realizing you ca n't have the career you want now .
You realize you ca n't have the son you want now , or you ca n't give a brother to your son .
Many <unk> and <unk> see themselves , and I 'm sitting in the room , and they talk about their <unk> , `` What was I doing ? What was I thinking ? ''
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking .
Here 's a story of how it might be .
It 's a story about a woman named Emma .
By 25 , Emma came to my office because he was , in his own words , having an identity crisis .
He said he 'd like to work in art or entertainment , but I could n't yet decide , so I spent the last few years working as a <unk> .
As it was cheaper , he lived with a boyfriend who was more humble to ambition .
And despite living a very difficult <unk> , his previous life had been even harder .
They often put it on our sessions , but then they 'd get up there by saying , `` You do n't choose your family , but you can choose your friends . ''
Well , one day , Emma came his head on his legs and cried for almost every time .
I had just bought a new book book for a directory , and I 'd spent the whole morning going with his many contacts , but then he kept looking at the empty space that follows after the words , `` In case I call it . ''
I was about the hysteria hysteria when he saw me and said , `` Who is going to be for me if I have a car accident ?
Who 's going to take care of me if it 's cancer ? ''
At that time , it took a lot of work to resist and not say , `` I . ''
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really worried about .
Emma needed a better life , and I knew this was his opportunity .
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decisive decade of Emma walked in front .
So , over the course of weeks and months , I told Emma three things that all 20-year-old , man or woman , deserves to know .
First , I said to Emma that he would be forgotten about that identity crisis and <unk> identity capital .
For identity capital , I 'm talking about doing something that add value to your person .
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be after .
I did n't know the future of Emma 's career , and nobody knows the future of the work , but I know this : identity capital creates identity capital .
So now it 's time for that job on the other side of the country , from that boarding school , of that company who want to test .
I 'm not rejecting <unk> exploration , I 'm <unk> that I should n't count , that by the way , it 's not exploration .
It 's <unk> .
I said to Emma that would explore work and I did them count .
Second , I told her to Emma that the urban tribes are <unk> .
The best friends are great to take you back to the airport , but the <unk> that come together with friends with similar minds to you as much as who you know , what you think about , how do you think , how they 're talking , and where you work .
That new piece of capital , that new person with whom is almost always coming from the nearest circle .
The new things come from what they call the weak ties of friends from their friends .
Yes , half of them have a bad job or they do n't have work .
But the other half did not , and the weak bonds are the way we get to this group .
Half the work they never released , then to meet the chief of your neighbor is the way we get a job that 's not published .
It 's not cheating . It 's the science of how information happens .
Last but not least , Emma believed that you do n't choose your family , but I know your friends .
This was true when I was growing up , but as <unk> , she soon loved her family , when she has a mate and form his own family .
I told Emma that the time to choose her family had come .
Maybe you think 30 is better age to sit on your head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you .
But pick up the person that you 're living with now or <unk> you now when you 're all on Facebook , start walking towards the altar is not progress .
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have , and that involves being as intentional in love as you are at work .
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who , and what you want instead of just doing it will work or kill time with whatever you choose .
So what happened to Emma ?
Well , we looked at that directory , and she found out to the roommate of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state .
This weak tie helped get a job there .
That supply supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with which he lived .
Now , five years later , it 's a special place in museums in museums .
She 's married with a man who chose consciously .
She loves his new career , he loves her new family , and I sent him a letter that said , `` Now the emergency spaces are not big enough . ''
Emma 's story may sound easy , but that 's what I love to work with <unk> .
It 's very easy to help them .
<unk> are like planes coming out of the L.A. airport , which come out somewhere in the west .
Just before takeoff , a slight set on their trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in Fiji .
In the same way , 21 or even 25 and even the 29 , a good conversation , a good TED Talk , a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even the next generations .
Here 's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> you know .
It 's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex .
It 's what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day : The <unk> are not the new <unk> , <unk> their adulthood , get your identity capital , use their weak ties , pick your family .
They 're not going to be defined by what they did n't know or what they did n't .
They 're deciding their life today .
Thank you .
When I was 27 years old , I left a very intensive job in management consultancy for a job that was even more <unk> : the faculty .
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh grade students in New York City .
And as any teacher , I took tests and testing .
I give you tasks .
When I went back , I <unk> grades .
What struck me was that I.Q . was not the only difference between my best and the worst students .
Some of those who had better performance do n't have scores of I.Q . scores .
Some of my smartest kids were n't going so well .
And that got me thinking .
The kind of things you need to learn in math in seventh grade , secure , are difficult : proportions , <unk> , the area of a <unk> .
But these concepts are not impossible , and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard , and over time enough .
After several years of faculty , I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective , from a psychological perspective .
In education , the only thing we know how to measure better ways .
It 's the <unk> , but what happens if success in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn very quickly and easy ?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a psychologist .
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of challenging scenarios , and in every study my question was , who is successful here and why ?
My research team and I went to the New <unk> Academy Point .
We 're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk> .
We went to the National Yo-Yo Contest , and we 're trying to predict what children were going on as far as possible in the competition .
We studied teachers working in <unk> neighborhoods , which teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and those , who will be the most effective in improving outcomes of learning learning ?
We teamed up with private companies , asking , what about these marketers are going to keep their job jobs ?
And who 's going to make more money ?
In all those different contexts , it emerged a feature as a major predictor of success .
And it was n't social intelligence .
It was n't the good appearance , physical health and not I.Q .
It was determination .
Road is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals .
Road is to have resistance .
<unk> is clinging to its future , day after day , not only a week , not only for the month , but for years and working hard to make that future a reality .
Road is to live life as if it was a marathon , not a sprint .
A few years ago , I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago .
I asked thousands of high school students who were doing my questionnaires , and then waited for more than a year to see who were <unk> .
It turns out that children with more determination were significantly greater than graduation , even when the <unk> on every feature that I could measure , things like family income , the results of standardized tests , even the security that they felt when they were in school .
So it 's not only in West Point or at the National Contest of <unk> in which it matters , it 's also in school , especially for kids at risk of <unk> .
For me , the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing we know , how little science knows about its development .
Every day , parents and teachers ask me , `` How do you develop purpose in children ?
What should I do to teach kids a solid work firm ?
How do I keep them motivated for the long term ? ''
The most honest answer is , I do n't know . What I know is that talent does n't give you purpose .
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do n't follow with their commitments .
In fact , in our data , commonly no related , or it 's even related to backwards measures .
So far , the best idea I 've ever heard about developing children is something called `` growth mindset . ''
This is an idea that at Stanford University for Carol <unk> , and it 's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change the effort .
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes , and it 's growing in response to the challenge , they 're much more likely to <unk> when they fail , because they do n't think that failure is a permanent condition .
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination .
But we need more .
And that 's where I end my speech , because that 's where we are .
That 's the work we have in front of us .
We need to take our best ideas , our stronger intuitions , and we need to test them .
We need to measure whether they 've been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , wrong , get it wrong with the lessons that we learned .
In other words , we need to be certain about making our kids more determined .
Thank you .
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> , one of my more <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese character .
From that moment , I 'm going to be obsessed with this incredible language .
But for a foreigner , it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China .
In the last few years , I 've been wondering if I can break down this wall , so whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that .
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful .
Since I was five years old , I began to learn how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence .
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years .
Because we have only five minutes , it 's better than we do it from a faster and a way .
A Chinese academic academics would have 20 characters .
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy .
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature , enough to read traffic signals , menus menus , understanding the basic idea of web pages or the newspapers .
I 'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
Are you ready ?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it 's square .
They get a mouth .
This is a person who 's going to take a walk .
<unk> .
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides , as they were screaming correctly , `` Help me ! I 'm burning ! '' This symbol actually is actually <unk> ! '' This symbol is actually originally proof of the shape of the flame , but I like to believe it 's the other way . The one that will work .
This is a tree .
tree tree tree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> doors in the old West .
I call these eight characters .
They 're building blocks so they create a lot more characters .
A person .
If someone walks back , that 's `` follow . ''
As the old said , two are company , three are a crowd .
If a person stretch their arms , this person is saying , `` It was like this big . ''
The person inside the mouth , the person is stuck .
It 's a prisoner , just like <unk> inside the whale .
A tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have a forest .
Three trees together , we also have the forest .
Put a chart under the tree , we have the foundations .
You put a mouth on the tree , that 's an `` idiot . '' Easy to remember , because a <unk> tree is quite an idiot .
Remember the fire ?
Two fires together , it 's very hot .
Three fires , that 's a lot of flames .
Put the fire under the two trees , that 's burning .
For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
Two suns together , prosperous .
Three together , those are flashes .
Put the sun and the moon shining together , that 's the brightness .
It also means tomorrow , after one day and one night .
The sun comes out on the horizon . <unk> .
A door . Put a chart inside the door , it 's the <unk> of the door .
Put a mouth inside the door , ask questions .
He hit , played with somebody at home ?
This person is coming out of a door , fleeing , <unk> .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they 're discussing .
Three women together , be careful , adultery .
So we 've already gone through about 30 characters .
By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 .
The next group of eight characters will build another 32 .
So with every little effort you 're going to be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters , which is the same thing as learning a Chinese Chinese .
So after knowing the characters , we started creating sentences .
For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have a mountain of fire . It 's a volcano .
We know that Japan is the rising sun .
This is a sun put in the origin , because Japan is in China .
So a sun next to where we created Japan .
A person behind Japan , what do we have ?
A Japanese person .
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other .
In the ancient China , that meant in exile , because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains .
Today , the exile has become one .
A mouth that tells you to where it is an exit .
This is a slide to remind you that I should stop talking and go down the stage . Thank you .
What I prefer to be dad is the movies that I get to see .
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids -- when my daughter was four , we saw the Oz magician together .
The film mastered its imagination for months .
His favorite character was <unk> , of course .
He gave him a good excuse to wear a bright dress and bring a magic wand .
But when you see that film so many times , you get to understand that it 's extraordinary .
We now live and raise our kids into a kind of industrial complex fashion shows .
However , The Oz magician was an event itself .
It did n't start that trend .
The trend really took 40 years later with , interestingly , another movie whose protagonists , a metal guy and a <unk> guy <unk> a girl dressed as the enemy of the enemy .
You know what I 'm talking about ? Yes .
There 's a huge difference between these two films , there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today .
One is that there 's very little violence in the magician 's magician .
The monkeys are pretty aggressive , like the apple caps .
But I think if The Oz magician is done today , the magician would say : Dorothy , you are salvation of Oz as the prophecy predicted .
You use magic shoes to defeat the armies created by the computer <unk> computer .
But that 's not what happens .
Another unique thing for the Oz magician is that the most heroic characters , wise characters and even villains are women .
I started to notice this when I made `` Star Wars '' to my daughter , a few years later , and the situation was different .
At that time , I had a son .
It 's only three years old .
It was n't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that .
But it was the second child , and the oversight level was down . So slid in the room , and I was impressed like a leg , and he was impressed like a leg of his leg with his <unk> behind , and I do n't think he understood what was going on , but , <unk> .
I wonder what perceived .
Would you be the issues of value , perseverance and loyalty ?
Would the feeling that Luke is one of an army to overthrow the government ?
<unk> this with the 1939 Oz magician .
How do you win his film ?
We 're doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk> .
It 's the kind of world I want my children to grow to Oz , right ? And not a world of men who struggle , that is where we are .
Why is there such an F capital , the force in the movies for our children , and so little from the road of yellow building ?
There 's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in girls , and they should read it . It 's very good .
I have n't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus .
Now , I know the experience that Princess <unk> does n't give me the right framework that had served me to sail through the world of adults who are blended . I think at the time of the first kiss , I really expected the credit of people to appear because it 's the end of the movie , right ?
My search is over , I have a girlfriend .
Why are they standing there ?
I do n't know what I should do .
The movies are focused on beat and get your reward , and they do n't leave time for other relationships or other adventures .
It 's almost like a child , you have to be a stupid animal , and if you 're a girl , you have to use a warrior 's suit .
There are a lot of exceptions , and defending the Disney princess to any of you .
But they send a message to the kids , even though they , kids , are not really their target public .
They do a phenomenal job when I teach girls how they defend girls , but they do n't necessarily show kids how they defend the patriarchy .
There is no model for them .
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children , so real and charming as <unk> and <unk> , but they 're not allowed to be movies movies .
Of course , the most successful issue of all time continues to show up in classic after classical after classic , each of them about the adventures of a child or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and their son , or two men who raised a child .
Until , like many of you are thinking , this year , it finally came out .
I recommend all of you . It 's available in stores .
Do you remember what the criticism said when they came out .
I ca n't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a princess .
It 's very good . Do n't let that stop !
Well , almost none of these films is the test of <unk> .
I do n't know if you 've heard about this .
It 's not yet thrown away , and it already spreads , but maybe today we 're going to start a movement .
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist , and in the mid-'80s , I recorded a conversation that I had had with a friend about the movie assessment that you saw .
And it 's very simple . There are only three questions that you need to be done : In the movie , there are more of a female character than the lines ?
So , you have to fulfill the requirement .
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie ?
Your conversations are about something else than the guy who likes to do ?
Two women who are there and they talk about things each other .
It happens . I 've seen it , and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love .
In fact , this week , I went to see a very good quality , <unk> .
Right ? <unk> of Oscar , <unk> , an idea of what is a Hollywood movie film .
Virtually , it does n't happen the <unk> .
And I do n't think it should be , because a lot of the film , I do n't know if you 've seen it , a lot of the film occurs in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the hostages of the hostage .
We have many scenes of men that have deep and painful conversations in this hide-and-seek , and that 's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say , `` You come to bed , honey ? ''
This is Hollywood .
So let 's put it into the numbers .
In 2011 , from the 100 more popular movies , how many of them believe they have female actors ?
Eleven . Not bad .
It 's not the same percentage as the number of women that we have recently chosen for Congress , then it 's okay .
But there 's a bigger number that 's going to be disappointed in this room .
Last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
This is what he said .
In the United States , one in five women says that it 's been sexually assaulted in his life .
I do n't think it 's the fault of mass entertainment .
I do n't think the movies for children have something to do with that .
I do n't think that music videos or pornography are closely linked , but something 's wrong , and when I hear that statistic , one of the things that I think is that there 's a lot of sexual <unk> .
Who are those guys ? What are those guys learning ?
What do n't they learn ?
They 're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to beat up with violence , and then charge the reward , which is a woman who has no friends and does n't speak ?
Are we <unk> that story ?
You know , as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing , we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk> it .
We have tools for our disposal as <unk> <unk> , and we hope that that helps , but I have to ask , <unk> <unk> will protect them if , at the same time , active or passively , are educating our children to keep their male power ?
I mean , I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important , and here I 'm talking about the parents .
I think we have to show our children a new definition of manhood .
The definition of masculinity is radically changing .
You 've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk> .
Everything is changing .
When I asked my daughter , what was his favorite `` favorite character from Star Wars , you know what he responded ? ''
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
What 's in common these two ?
Maybe it 's not just brilliant dress .
I think they 're experts .
I think these are the two people in those movies that they know more than anyone , and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us achieve their potential .
They are leaders .
I like that kind of stories for my daughter , and I like that kind of stories for my son .
I want more stories like that .
I want less stories in which I tell my son : Go and struggle only and more stories where it looked like his job is to join a team , maybe a team led by women , helping other people better and become better people , like magician 's magician .
Thank you .
As a girl , she lived in Maine , and one of the things that I was more like to look for from sea biscuits on the shores of Maine , because my parents told me that that would give me luck .
But you know , it 's hard to find these shells .
They 're covered in sand , and it 's hard to see them .
However , over time , I got used to look for them .
I started looking at ways and patterns that helped me <unk> .
This became a passion for finding things , in love for the past and the archaeology .
And finally when I started studying <unk> , I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough .
Because suddenly , in Egypt , my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles long and to the Nile .
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities .
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery .
To try and make a map of the past , I knew I had to see otherwise .
So I want to show you an example of how different we see when we 're using infrared .
This is a located in the eastern delta of Egypt called <unk> .
And the place , to the naked eye , seems to be brown , but when we use infrared , and we process it using fake color , suddenly the place looks like pink pink .
What you 're looking at are actual chemical changes of the landscape of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the old Egyptian .
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old <unk> city , called <unk> , lost for thousands of years .
<unk> was the oldest capital of Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago .
The place sits in the <unk> , Egypt , and it 's really important because in the Middle Empire , there was this great renaissance of ancient Egyptian art , architecture and religion .
The <unk> have known you that I was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that they built , indicated within the red circles here , but somewhere inside this massive <unk> .
This area is enormous , it 's about <unk> miles away .
Before , the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time , moved to the east , and it covered all the city .
So how do you find a city desert on a large landscape ?
Trying to find it at random , it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a haystack , blindfolded and using baseball gloves .
So , we use NASA mining data to make a map of the place , very subtle changes .
We were able to see where the Nile <unk> .
But you can see more closely , and it 's even more interesting , this slightly elevated area you see inside the circle here , that we think it might be the location of <unk> .
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing jobs , and they can see here .
When I say sampling , it 's like the shots of it in ice , but instead of layers of climate change , we 're looking for layers of human occupation .
Five meters down , under a thick layer of slime , we found a dense layer of pottery objects .
This means that in this possible location , five meters below , we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years that date back from the Middle Empire , exactly the same period that we think is <unk> .
We also found <unk> jobs -- <unk> , quartz and cat , which proves that there was a jewelry shop .
This might seem that it 's not a lot , but when we think about the most common stones used in the Middle Nations jewelry , these are the stones that were used .
So , we have a dense layer of occupation that leaves the Middle Empire in this place .
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that proves that what 's been there , was a very important city .
We do n't find any <unk> here , but they 're going to <unk> the place in the near future to localize .
And even more importantly , we have the resources to train Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they also can make great discoveries .
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire , probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago .
I share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk> .
There 's nothing like that on Earth .
So as it looks like , TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C .
Do ideas happen to happen in 1984 BC , in a lost city , not for a long time and found from the top .
It certainly puts the <unk> of <unk> in perspective .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I want to invite you to close your eyes .
Imagine standing outside , front of the door to <unk> .
I 'd like you to pay attention to the front of the door , the material that it 's made .
Now we 've got a bunch of <unk> obese .
They are competing at a bicycle cycle race , and they 're going to address their entry door .
I need to see this really .
They 're <unk> strong , they 're sweating , they 're jumping a lot .
And they collide against the door of their house .
There 's bicycles flying everywhere , wheels that go on the side , rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places , <unk> the door threshold .
In the lobby , in the hallway , or what there 's on the other side of the door , and look at the quality of light . The light shines on the <unk> of the <unk> .
He 's <unk> .
From his chair , on a brown horse .
It 's a horse that speaks .
You can feel your <unk> fur on your nose .
You can smell the oats of oats and go into the mouth .
<unk> on one side and trained your living room .
Already in the room , and doing most of your imagination , imagine Britney Spears .
It 's with little clothes , dancing about your center table , singing `` <unk> More Baby Time . ''
Now follow me to the kitchen .
The soil has been coated with a little yellow brick road , and from the oven they come up to Dorothy , the <unk> Man , the <unk> and the Len of `` The Wizard of Oz , '' <unk> hands , jumping toward you .
Okay . Open your eyes .
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes place every spring in New York .
It 's called the <unk> of <unk> in the United States .
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist , waiting for , I suppose , that this was like the end of a wise person .
There were several men and few different ages and different hygiene .
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers , watching them just once .
They were <unk> the names of dozens and tens of strangers .
It would take whole poems in just minutes .
<unk> to see who he could memorize the faster the order of a deck of cards .
And I thought , `` This is amazing . ''
These people must be the phenomena of nature .
And I started talking to some of the competitors .
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best trained memories .
I said , `` Ed , when did you realize that you were a wise ? ''
Ed replied , `` I 'm not a wise one .
Actually , I have an average memory .
Everybody who 's involved with this competition say they have normal memory .
`` We 've trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using these ancient memory acts of old techniques , invented a 2,500 years ago in Greece , the same techniques that used Cicero to memorize their speeches , and that medieval academics used them to memorize books . ''
And my reaction was , `` Wow . How did n't you have heard of this before ? ''
We were standing out of the room of the competition , and Ed , who 's a wonderful , brilliant English , even though a little <unk> , he said , `` Josh , you 're an American journalist .
Do you know Britney Spears ? ''
And I said , `` What ? No , why ?
`` Because I 'd like to teach Britney Spears and how you memorize order in a deck of cards in live television .
That would prove to the world anybody can do it . ''
And I said , `` Well , I 'm not Britney Spears , but maybe you can teach me to me .
Or do you have to start with something right ? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
And I ended up spending the most of the year after not just training my memory , but also <unk> , trying to understand how it works , why sometimes it does n't work and what its potential can be .
I met a lot of really interesting people .
This is a man called <unk> .
He 's <unk> , very likely to be the worst memory in the world .
His memory was so bad that he did n't even remember that he had a memory problem ; it 's amazing .
Someone was incredibly tragic , but it was a window that allows you to see how far our memory makes us who we are .
At the end of the spectrum , I met this man .
This is Kim Peek . He was based on the role of Dustin Hoffman in the movie `` Rain . ''
We spend a evening together in the public library in Salt Lake City , memorizing phone books ; it was sparkling .
And when I came back , a number of treaties on the memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin , in the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages .
And I learned a lot of really interesting things .
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having trained , disciplined and grown memory was n't a little thing as rare as you can be like today .
A long time ago , people invest in their memory , to provide <unk> their minds .
These techniques have made possible our modern world , but they have changed us .
They 've been culturally changed , and I would argue that they have changed as well .
As we already have no need to remember , sometimes it seems to have forgotten how to do it .
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a trained , disciplined memory , is this very unique competition of memory .
It 's not really that singular ; there are competitions like this worldwide .
And I was fascinated , I wanted to know how these people do .
A few years ago , a team of University College from London invited London to a group of memory champions .
They wanted to know : Is it that it has any brains of any way or a different structural or different number of the rest of us ?
The answer was , no .
Are they smarter than the rest ?
They gave them a <unk> battery , and the answer was actually not .
There was a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of the champions of memory champions and the subjects of control that you compared .
When they put them in an MRI machine , they would <unk> their brains , the faces and forms of snowflakes , they found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain , different to others .
They were actually used , or they looked at them , a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation .
Why ? Is there something we can learn from this ?
The tournament in memorizing competitive is running as an armed career where every year comes up with somebody with a new way to remember more things , faster , and then the rest of the competitors have to get to the day .
This is my friend Ben <unk> , three times a memory champion .
On his desk , in front of him , there are 36 <unk> of cards right that he 's about to try to memorize in an hour , using a technique that he invented , and he 's just mastered .
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> order of <unk> binary digits .
<unk> . Yeah .
And while there 's a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions , absolutely all the techniques used by the end , they cut down to one concept that psychologists call `` <unk> coding . ''
It illustrates a elegant paradox known as the paradox `` <unk> . '' [ <unk> ] says the next thing : I tell two people who remember the same word . I say to you , `` Remember , there 's a man called Baker . ''
That 's his name .
And then I ask you , `` Remember , there 's a <unk> .
And when I go back later , and I ask you , `` Do you remember that word I told you a while ago ? ''
`` Do you remember what it was ? ''
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said his job is `` <unk> . ''
The same word , different ability to remember -- that 's weird .
What happens here ?
Well , the Baker name , it does n't really mean anything for you .
All the other memories that are dancing by their head .
But the word , `` <unk> , '' we know about it .
They use white cowboy hats .
They have flour in the hands .
They get back home to work .
You probably know some baker .
And when we put that word for the first time , we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> them at some point back .
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two and a half thousand years in Ancient Greece .
It 's called the `` <unk> of the memory . ''
History says this : There was a poet called <unk> that was attending a <unk> .
They had hired like entertainment , because before , if he wanted to give a very good party , they would n't come to a DJ , and they 'd become a poet .
He stood up , <unk> his memory poem , and left , and so soon it was , the living room was collapsed .
We killing everyone .
But not only did it kill everyone , but it shattered the <unk> <unk> bodies .
No one could say who was there , nobody could remember where they were sitting there .
So you could n't afford them .
A tragedy behind the other .
<unk> , standing outside , only survivor , in the middle of the rubble , closed his eyes and realized that with his mind in his mind , I could see where he 'd been sitting every guest .
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were loved ones in the rubble .
What <unk> <unk> <unk> at that moment is something we all know more or less intuitively , and that is that no matter if we 're not good at remembering names or instructions or instructions for our colleagues , we have visual memory and exceptional spatial memory .
If you were to tell you that I was given the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> , it 's very likely to make it very hard .
But I 'm going to bet if you would tell you to say who I was sitting on the horse a brown speaker in your lobby , you would be able to <unk> it .
The idea of the palazzo of memory is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember . The more crazy , crazy , funny , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> the image , the most haunting .
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago , to the first treated of memory , Latin .
And how does it work ?
Let 's say you 've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk , and they want to do it from memory , in the same way that he had made it Cicero if they had been invited to <unk> it for 2,000 years ago .
What you might do is imagine you 're at the door of your house .
And you come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous , crazy image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition .
And then you can imagine entering your house , and see the <unk> of the <unk> on top of Mister Ed .
And that will remember you want to introduce your friend Ed Cook .
And then I would see Britney Spears to remind you that funny story that you want to count .
And then they put in the kitchen , and the fourth issue that they talked about would be that strange journey that they did for a year , and they have some friends to help you remember it .
This is how the Roman <unk> <unk> their speeches , not word for word , which is going to confuse them , but typical of them .
In fact the `` typical '' term comes from the Greek `` <unk> , '' which means `` place . ''
It 's a <unk> of when people thought of speaking and in rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms .
The phrase `` First of all , '' would be like the first place in its memory palace .
I saw this was just fascinating , and I got stuck on it .
I went to some of these memory skills and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this competitive <unk> subculture .
But there was a problem .
The problem was that a memory competition is pathologically boring .
So seriously , it 's like seeing a lot of people sitting sitting on exams . I mean , the most exciting thing that happens is when you get in front of you .
I 'm a journalist , and I need to be able to write about something .
I know there are amazing things happening in these people 's minds , but I do n't have access .
I realized that if I was going to tell this story , I needed to try to put myself in the place .
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning , before I sit there to see the New York Times , just trying to remember something .
Maybe a poem , or the names of an old school yearbook bought in a <unk> market .
And I discovered that this was entertaining <unk> .
I would never expect it to be .
It was fun , because it was n't just about training the memory .
What 's actually about doing is better to improve the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous , cartoons , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and hopefully <unk> , in the eye of the mind .
I was hooked pretty much with this .
This is me , using my standard training team for memory competition .
It 's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape , leaving only two <unk> , because distraction is the worst enemy of a memory competitor .
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before . I had the idea that I could enter , in a kind of a participatory journalism experiment .
I thought this could be a good predictor for my whole research .
The problem was that the experiment came out of control .
And I won the competition , something that did n't have to happen .
Of course , it 's nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers , and shopping lists , but actually this is not the point .
These are so just tricks .
Because they 're based on very basic principles about how the brain works .
And you do n't need to be able to build the memory of the memory or memorize <unk> of cards , to benefit with a little insights about how your mind works .
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was an innate gift , but it 's not the case .
The great memories get educated .
At the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention .
We 're very deeply focused on us .
The memory of the memory -- these memory techniques , are just shortcuts .
In fact , they 're not even shortcuts .
They work because they make us <unk> .
It would take a kind of deep processing , a kind of complete attention that most of the way that most of it is not going to go through it .
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts .
That 's how things become memorable .
And if there 's something I want to leave you with today , it 's what I mean , the <unk> that I could n't even remember that I had a memory problem , I left myself , which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories .
How much are we willing to lose of what 's already our short existence on the Blackberries or iPhone , not paying attention to the human being in front of us , who walks on our side . We 're going to be so <unk> that we 're not even going to be able to be able to be able to do deep in process ?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities that are at all of us at all .
But if you want to live a memorable life , you have to be the kind of person that remember remembering .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture .
It 's a lot to cover in 18 minutes .
It 's a complex topic , so you just put a complex place : New Jersey .
Because 30 years ago , I 'm from 19 years old , I 'm from <unk> , I was six and living there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> , and this was my child bedroom .
In the corner , since my bedroom , I was the bathroom I shared with my sister .
And between my bedroom and the bathroom , there was a balcony that I gave to the living room .
And there 's all the time looking at TV . So every time I went from my room to the bathroom , you would all see me , and every time I <unk> and wrapped up in a towel , you all see me .
And I was like that .
It was awkward , insecure , and hated it .
He hated that balcony , hated that balcony , hated that room and that house .
That 's architecture .
All right .
Those feelings , those emotions that I felt , that is the power of architecture , because architecture is not about math , and it 's not about <unk> and <unk> connections , but that we feel in the places we deal with .
And it 's not surprising that we feel that way , because according to the Environmental Protection Agency , Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof .
I mean , 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture .
That 's a lot .
So architecture determines us in ways that we do n't even realize .
That makes us a little naive and very , very predictable .
This means that when I show you a building like this , I know what it tells you : you think of `` power '' , `` stability '' and `` democracy . ''
And I know they 're thinking about it that 's based on a building that built years ago by the Greeks .
This is a trick .
It 's a <unk> that the architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings .
It 's a predictable emotional connection ; we 've used this trick for a long , long time .
We use it 200 years ago to build banks .
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums .
And in the 20th century , we used it to build houses .
Look , these stable , stable , <unk> , front of the elements .
This is very , very useful , because building things is terrifying .
It 's expensive , it takes a lot of time and it 's very complicated .
The people who build . <unk> and governments , they always have fear of innovation , and they prefer to use ways that you know they 're going to work .
So we find ourselves with buildings like this .
It 's a nice building .
It 's the <unk> Public Library , which was finished in 2004 , in my hometown , and , you know , he 's got a dome ; it has this round thing , columns , columns , red , that leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this building : children , ownership values , history .
But it does n't have a lot to do with a library today .
That same year , in 2004 , on the other side of the country , there was another library that looks like this .
It 's in Seattle .
This library shows how we use media in the digital age .
It 's a new kind of public equipment for the city , a place to come together , read and sharing .
So how is it possible that in the same year , in the same country , two buildings , both called libraries , are so completely different ?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the pendulum .
On one side is innovation ; architects who are constantly driving new technologies , new <unk> , new solutions for the forms of life today .
We 're going to push it and we 'll push it so much , that we get away from the people .
Now , all of the black , this is too depressing . You think we feel very well , but we 're dead inside because we have no choice .
We need to go on the other side and get to connect with these appreciated that are appreciated .
So we do it , and we 're all happy , but we 're all happy , but we 're going to feel like <unk> , and we can swing the pendulum back to go ahead , over and over again . So we 've done it in the last 300 years , and of course , in the last 30 years .
Well , 30 years ago , <unk> years ago .
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk> .
It 's about the concrete .
You can guess .
<unk> , in a scale .
It 's really very hard .
So we 're approaching the '80s , and we started to incorporate those symbols .
<unk> the pendulum back in the other direction .
We take those shapes that we know that we like and <unk> them .
We added to neon and we add cake and use new materials .
They love it .
We do n't take <unk> .
We take <unk> <unk> , and we turned them into skyscrapers , which can be <unk> eggs .
So the shapes are <unk> , they won in the breath .
<unk> became columns .
Should grew up to the size of buildings .
<unk> .
But it was the '80s , that was great .
We all spent time in commercial centers , and we moved to the neighborhoods , and there , in the suburbs , we can create our own architectural fantasies .
Those fantasies could be to the Mediterranean , the French , or to the Italian .
Possibly with endless sticks of bread .
This is what happens to <unk> .
This is what happens to the symbols .
They 're easy , they 're cheap , because instead of creating new spaces , <unk> memories of other places .
I know very well , and all of you know , this is not the Tuscany .
This is Ohio .
Architects are feeling frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum back into the other direction .
In the '80s , in the early '90s , we started to experiment with the <unk> <unk> .
We have the historical symbols of the historical symbols -- we now have new techniques of <unk> design techniques , and we find ourselves with new compositions -- some ways that are <unk> against other forms .
This is an academic and <unk> , and it 's <unk> ; you 're totally excluded .
Normally the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction .
But then something amazing happened .
In 1997 , this building is opened .
This is the Guggenheim of Bilbao , of Frank Gehry .
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture .
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical , academics and public public in general , were completely agreed on a building .
The New York Times <unk> this miracle building .
<unk> in Bilbao grew up by a thousand percent when the building ended .
So suddenly , everybody wanted one of those buildings : Los Angeles , Seattle , Chicago , New York , Cleveland , <unk> .
Everybody wanted one , and Gehry was everywhere .
He was our first star architect .
But how is it possible that these forms , wild and radical , how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world ?
And it happened , because media <unk> around them , and we quickly learned that those forms and culture meant .
We 've created an emotional reaction with these shapes .
The same thing did the major mayors in the world .
So everyone believed that if they had these shapes , they had culture and tourism .
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium happened with other star architects .
And I went to <unk> and Libeskind , and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium , actually began to happen with all the architecture , the digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption .
Think of it , for example , how you use architecture .
A thousand years ago , they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building .
transportation is accelerating : you can take a ship , an airplane , you can be tourists .
Technology accelerates . You can see in the newspapers , on TV , and at the end , we are all photographers and architecture and the building is carried beyond its physical location .
So architecture is everywhere now ; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture .
Because architecture is moving so fast .
It 's not very precise to think about a building .
It takes a long time to build a building , three or four years , and in the time , an architect can design two , eight , or 100 buildings , before I know that the one that designed four years ago was a success or not .
Because there 's never been good feedback in architecture .
That 's how we find ourselves with buildings like this .
The <unk> was n't a two-year , but 20 years old .
For 20 years , we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk> are .
That 's never going to happen again . I believe , because we are at the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of concrete , steel or the elevator , and it 's the media revolution .
My theory is that when the pendulum applied to the media , it starts to swing faster and faster , until they will be in both extremes , and it 's actually <unk> , and they would effectively make the difference between innovation and symbol , between us , architects , and you , the audience .
Now we can make <unk> symbols , with emotional burden , completely new .
I 'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently .
We were <unk> to replace this building that burned up .
This is the center of a village called <unk> Island <unk> in the state of New York .
It 's a vacation community .
But that meant that two years before the building would end , it was part of the community , and as the drawings looked exactly the product done , there were no surprises .
The building came to be part of the community . That first summer , when people started to reach and share it in social media , the building stopped being just a building , it became a media medium , because these are not just images of a building , it 's the images that one made out of the building .
And as you use them to tell your story , they become part of personal narrative , and that makes it <unk> with collective memory , and by carrying these symbols , we learn .
I mean , we do n't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture .
We can tell each other what we think about architecture , because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us , but they have changed the relationship between us and the buildings .
Think for a second in those <unk> librarians .
If that building are built today , first we 're going to Internet searching for `` new libraries . ''
I be bombarded with examples of experimentation , innovation , about what a library can be .
That 's ammunition .
<unk> that can take the mayor of <unk> , the <unk> people , and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library can be today .
Let 's be part of this .
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experiment .
It 's all different now .
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures using <unk> words and complicated drawings , and you 're not a hapless audience that does n't embrace something that you have n't seen before .
The architects can listen , and you do n't have to intimidate by architecture .
That means the pendulum <unk> from one style to another , of one movement to another , is irrelevant .
In fact , we can keep going and find right solutions to the problems facing society .
This is the end of the history of architecture , and it means that the buildings in tomorrow will be very different than the buildings today .
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city .
This means a stadium in Brooklyn can be that , a stadium in Brooklyn , and not a bad <unk> imitation of red brick based on what a stadium should be .
This means some robots can be able to build our buildings , because we will finally be ready for the shapes that they 're going to produce .
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not otherwise .
This means a parking garage in Miami Beach , Florida , it can also serve for sport or for yoga , or even one can get married in the night .
This means that three architects can dream of swimming on the East River New York , and raising half a million dollars of the community together around that cause , is no longer a client .
It means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little <unk> of names , so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to look like .
Because no matter whether it 's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings .
No matter how we build , what matters is what we build .
Architects already know how to make more ecological buildings , smarter and kinder .
We 've been waiting for all of you .
Finally , we 're not on opposite sides .
Find an architect , <unk> and work together to make better buildings , better cities , for a better world , because there 's a lot of play .
The buildings are not just reflecting our society , but they shape the way to the smallest spaces , local libraries , the homes where we form our children , and the room of the bedroom to the bathroom .
Thank you very much .
This is my niece , <unk> .
It just turned a year and she started walking .
And it makes it in that great way , typical children of a year , <unk> , as if their body was moving too fast to their legs .
It 's totally precious .
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror .
She really loves his reflection .
He 's laughing and <unk> , and it gives itself those big , wet kisses .
It 's beautiful .
Apparently , all of his friends do this , and my mom tells me that I used to do this , and it made me think , `` When did I do this ?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our appearance ?
Because , apparently , we do n't like it .
Every month , 10,000 people Google Google : `` Am I ugly ? ''
This is <unk> , it 's 13 years old and lives in Denver .
And as any teenager , it only wants to be dear and fit .
It 's Sunday at night .
It 's preparing for the next week in school .
It 's a little bit of fear , it 's a little bit confused , because , even though her mom says it all the time it 's beautiful , every day in school , someone says it 's ugly .
Among what your mom says and what his friends , or school friends say , he does n't know who to believe .
So a video of it , it publishes on YouTube , and ask others that please leave a comment , `` Am I pretty , or am I ugly ? ''
Well , until now , <unk> has received more than 13,000 comments .
Some of these are so disgusting that they do n't even deserve to think about them .
We talk about a healthy , normal teenager , who receives these answers at one of the most stages of their life more emotionally .
Thousands of people are posting videos like this , mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way .
But what 's driving them to do this ?
Well , teenagers today are almost never alone .
They 're under pressure to be online and available all the time , talking , <unk> , giving `` I like , '' talking , sharing , publishing , this never ends .
We 've never been so connected , in a continuous way , so young , so young .
As a mother said to me , `` It 's like there 's a party in his bedroom every night . ''
There 's just no privacy .
And the social pressures that 's going out of the hand with that is just just a story .
This environment , of being connected , is <unk> to our kids based on the number of `` I like '' that they have and the kinds of comments they get .
There is no division between a online and real life .
It 's really hard to know the differences between what 's real or what it is n't .
And also , it 's very difficult to know the difference between what 's authentic and what it is digitally manipulated .
What is the highlight of somebody in front of what is normal in a daily context ?
And where are they looking for inspiration ?
Well , you can see the kind of images that are covers of the girls ' news .
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk> .
The technique of <unk> is now a routine .
And trends like : # <unk> , # <unk> , # <unk> and # <unk> .
For those of you who <unk> it , # <unk> means <unk> .
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today .
It 's not hard to see with what young people compare .
But kids are not immune to this .
Like the <unk> stars in the sports stars , and the singers in the field .
But what 's the problem with all this ?
Well , we surely want our kids to grow healthy , and they 're very <unk> individuals .
But in a <unk> culture , we 're teaching our children to spend more time and information effort on their appearance , at the price of all other aspects of their identity .
Things like their relationships , the development of their physical capacities , their studies and other aspects begin to suffer .
Six of the 10 girls would rather do something because they think they do n't see enough enough .
These are not trivial activities .
These are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and as contributors to society and labor development .
31 percent , almost one in three teenagers are not interested in classroom arguments , to participate in the classroom , because they do n't want to attract attention to their physical side .
One in five are not attending class at all days when they 're not comfortable with it .
And in the tests of exams , if you do n't think you see good enough , specifically if you do n't think you 're thin enough , you 'll get a note smaller than the average of your partners who do n't care about the appearance .
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland , and the United States and China .
And it turns out regardless of what these young people weigh .
So , to be clear , we 're talking about as you see you , not how you 're really .
<unk> on your body is <unk> the academic performance .
And it 's also <unk> health .
Kids with little self-esteem do less physical activity , they eat less fruit and vegetables , they participate in more diet you do n't healthy that you can take them into a food disorder .
They low self-esteem .
They 're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they 're at greatest risk of depression .
And we think that 's all of these things that are more risky decisions , like alcohol consumption and drug consumption , dramatic diets , aesthetic surgery , <unk> sexual activity and <unk> and <unk> damage .
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health care system , and our government costs billions of dollars every year .
And we 're not controlling it .
Women who believe that they 're overweight again , regardless of whether they have no higher rates of sleep rates .
<unk> percent of women do n't present to a job interview in a day where they do n't feel secure as they look .
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy .
If we could overcome this , what would be that opportunity ?
<unk> this potential is of interest for each of us .
But how do we do that ?
Well , speaking , it does n't just take you very far .
It 's not enough .
If you really want to change things , you have to do something .
And we 've learned that there are three key ways . The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body .
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-worth .
The good news is that there are lots of programs available to do it .
The bad news is that most of these do n't work .
I became very surprised when I learned that many well-meaning programs , without realizing it , make it worse .
So we have to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact , but also a lasting impact .
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas . The first is the influence of family , friends and relationships .
These six things are crucial points for anyone willing to provide an education in your body 's body 's self-esteem .
A education is critical , but facing this problem requires each one of us to take the driver on the issue , and we are a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives .
It challenging the current status of how women are seen , and I mentioned in our circles .
It 's not good to tell with the contribution of our politicians in hair or the size of their breasts , or to <unk> that purpose or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it 's not a great beauty .
We need to start judging people by what they are , not as you see .
We can all begin by doing that by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published in our social networks .
We can praise people based on their effort and their actions , not in their appearance .
And let me ask you : When was the last time you 've got a mirror ?
In short , we need to work together as communities , like governments and as companies , to truly change our culture , so that our children will actually change their entire person , valuing their individuality , diversity , inclusion .
We need to put people that really making a difference on a pedestal .
It 's going to make a difference in the real world , let them be those who come out on the big screen , because we just create a different world .
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves , where the way they believe that they are ever seen the <unk> of being who are , or to reach what they want in their lives .
Think of what this can mean for someone in their lives .
Who are you in mind ?
Your wife ?
Her sister ?
Your daughter ?
Do he niece ? A friend ?
Could it be just the woman who 's at two seats away . What would it mean to her if it was released from that voice <unk> in his inside , that I 'm haunted by not having long legs , double-click , <unk> , more flat belly , smaller feet ?
What would it mean for that , if we did this , and would we unlock the potential of that way ?
Right now , the obsession with our culture with images is holding back to us .
But let 's give our kids the truth .
And I think that the way you see you are just a part of your identity , and the truth is that we love those who are and what they do , and because they make us feel .
They <unk> the self-worth in the rsums of our schools .
Let 's change each of us , the way we talk about and compared to other people .
And to work together as a community , from small groups to governments , so that the small ones of a year of age today are becoming insurance agents of themselves tomorrow .
Let 's do it .
On November 5 , 1990 , a gentleman called <unk> <unk> went into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi named <unk> <unk> , the League of Defense <unk> .
And initially , initially , they were actually declared innocent , but being in jail for other minor charges , in company company , they started planning to plan for attacks from about 12 , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations headquarters .
Luckily , those plans was <unk> by an FBI informant .
Sadly , the <unk> of 1993 in the World Trade Center , it could not be avoided .
Later , <unk> would be convicted of his participation in that bombing .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in 1983 , as he was an Egyptian engineer , with a <unk> American mother , the primary school teacher , the two did all the possible childhood to give me a happy childhood .
Only when I was seven years old , our family started to change .
My father taught me a form of Islam , which very few , including most Muslims , get to know .
For experience , I saw that when people take time to interact , it does n't require a lot to get the same things in life .
However , in all of religion , in every single religion , there 's always a tiny fraction of people who were being used to be used to their convictions that they think we have to use all possible media so that they all lived as them .
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekend , he said , and some friends , they had been going to target training in Long Island , to practice .
He told me that I would go with him the next day .
We arrived at the shooting <unk> , which , without knowing our group , was under the FBI .
When I was playing , my father helped me hold the rifle on my shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters .
That day , with the last bullet that shot gave him the little orange light on the target and , to surprise you all , especially of me , the whole goal broke out .
My uncle turned to each other and in Arabic , he said , `` <unk> <unk> . ''
As a parent , such a son .
Everybody , the comment gives you a lot of laughter , but just a few years later I understood what they were so funny to you .
They saw the same level of destruction that my father could cause .
Those people later would be condemned by putting them down , they 're going charged with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center , causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000 .
I admired those men .
He called them `` <unk> , '' which means uncle .
When I turned 19 , I had moved 20 times , that instability during my childhood did n't allow me to make a lot of friendships .
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was time to pack and go to another city .
As I was always , the new face of the class was often the victim of <unk> .
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white . But it will be the new of the class , silent and a <unk> , was enough ammunition .
So most of the time he was at home reading books , watching TV , or playing video games .
For these reasons I did n't have social skills , to say it very gently , for growing up <unk> , I was n't ready for the real world .
I was raised <unk> <unk> judging people , based on arbitrary indicators , like their race or their religion .
So how could I open your eyes ?
One of the first experiences that they tested my thinking was during 2000 elections .
In a <unk> program that I was in the National National Convention in Philadelphia .
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence , as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all of my life , was something that I felt a lot of passion .
The members of this group came from various backgrounds .
One day , at the end of the convention , I discovered that one of the kids who we had done with whom we had done , I was Jewish .
So I took a lot of days out to light this detail , and I realized there was n't any pull-ups between the two .
I had never had a Jewish friend , and frankly , I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all of life had made me believe it was <unk> .
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job on Bush Gardens , an amusement park .
I met people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures , and that experience was fundamental to the development of my character .
All of life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and , by extension , all of the gay people were bad influences .
By chance , I had the opportunity to work with gay actors in there , in a show , and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critical critics who had seen in life .
Having been bullied as a child , I developed a sense of empathy for others ' suffering , but it was n't easy to treat people kind , exactly the way I wish I 'd wish to be treated .
And so feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child , with the experience of interaction in real life .
I do n't know how to be homosexual , but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control .
Then the Daily Show the Daily Show .
Every night , Jon Stewart made me be honest about my <unk> , and I was helping me see that the race of people , religion or sexual orientation , do n't have anything to do with character .
In many ways he became my paternal figure at a moment when I was desperately <unk> .
Occasionally , inspiration can come from the unexpected , and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life that my own father , extremist , was not in vain .
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking , and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever , while it 's alive .
She looked at me with the <unk> eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless dogmatism and said , `` I 'm tired of hate . ''
At that point , I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside .
My real name is not <unk> <unk> .
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life .
So why did I go out and put myself in a risk ?
Well , it 's simple .
I 've done it because I hope that someone , one day , who 's about to lead to violence , can listen to my story and understand that there 's a better way , which is a better path , that although I gave me to this violent ideology and <unk> , I did n't get to get myself .
On the contrary , I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and prejudice .
I do it by the victims of terrorism and loved ones , and the loss that terrorism has produced to them in their lives .
For the victims of terrorism , I 'll talk to those <unk> acts , as rejection to my father 's actions .
With this simplicity show me here as proof that violence is not compelling to any religion or race , that children do n't have to follow the paths of their parents .
I 'm not my father .
Thank you . Thank you all . Thank you very much .
Right now , there is a film that 's projected in their minds .
It 's an amazing <unk> film .
It 's in 3D , and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now , but that 's just the beginning .
Your film is smell , taste and texture .
It feels your body , your pain , your hunger , your pleasure .
It has emotions , anger and happiness .
It has memories , as a moments of your childhood that project itself to your eyes .
And he 's constantly a voice superimposed into your conscious thinking .
The movie 's heart is you who experiences everything in direct .
This film is your flow of consciousness , the subject of experience of mind and the world .
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths to be human beings .
Each of us is conscious .
We all have an internal film , tea , tea and you .
There 's nothing that you know more directly .
At least , I know I have a sense of consciousness .
I have no certainty that you are conscious .
Consciousness is also the reason to live .
If we were n't conscious , nothing in our lives would make sense or value .
But at the same time it is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe .
Why are we conscious ?
Why do we have these internal movies ?
Why are n't we just robots that we have to produce to produce results without experiencing the internal movie ?
Right now , nobody knows the answers to those questions .
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science , you need some radical ideas .
Some people say it 's impossible to be a science of consciousness .
Science , by nature , is objective .
Consciousness , by nature , is subjective .
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
Because for most of the 20th century , they would get that vision .
psychology was studying objectively neuroscience , neuroscience was studying brain objectively but never had no one mention consciousness .
Even 30 years ago , when TED began , there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness .
After 20 years , it all began to change .
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists as Roger Penrose said , `` now is the time for science to reform consciousness . ''
And since then , there was a real bang , a flourishing of scientific work about consciousness .
And this work was fantastic . It was great .
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment .
The core of the science of consciousness in recent years was searching for correlations , correlations among some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness .
We saw some of this kind of thing in the fantastic job that I showed <unk> <unk> a few minutes ago .
Now we understand much better , for example , the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of faces or feeling pain or feeling happy .
But this is still a science of correlations .
It 's not a science of explanations .
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences , but we do n't know why .
I 'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness , the questions that they do certain areas of the brain and what correlate it .
But in a sense , those are the easy problems .
No offense to neuroscientists .
Actually , there 's no easy problems with consciousness .
Well , do n't I address the real puzzle of this matter : Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness ?
Why is there a subjective internal film ?
Right now , we ca n't understand it .
And you can say , let 's give you a few years to neuroscience .
It 's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like traffic jams , like hurricanes , like life , and we 're going to find explanation .
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors , how the traffic jams , how the hurricanes work , how they breed , and synthesizing living organisms , and they 're all questions about how it works .
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as an emergent phenomenon , how we walk , how we walk , how we walk , how we play chess ; they 're all questions about behavior .
But when it comes to consciousness , the questions about behavior are among the easy problems .
But the hard problem , is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by a subjective experience ?
And here it is , the standard paradigm of emergence , the standard paradigm of neuroscience , actually does n't have a lot to say .
I am a <unk> scientist .
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works . For a long time , I was beating my head against the wall , looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of consciousness that would work .
But at the end , I got to the conclusion that that did n't work for systematic reasons .
I think we 're going to get stuck at this point .
We have a wonderful string of explanations , great . We got used to this -- the physics explains the chemistry , chemistry explains biology , biology explains part of psychology .
But consciousness does n't seem to fit into this scheme .
On the one hand , it 's a fact that we are conscious .
On the other , we do n't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific worldview .
I think consciousness , right now , is a kind of anomaly , something that we need to integrate to our worldview , but we do n't know yet .
With an anomaly like this , you can need radical ideas . I think we need ideas that at first start crazy , before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way .
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas .
My friend Dan Dennett , who 's here today , has one .
Your crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness .
All the idea of the subjective film is includes kind of an illusion or confusion .
Actually , what you need to do , is to explain the objective functions , the behaviors of the brain , and you study everything that needs explanation .
Well , more power for him .
That 's the radical kind of idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure reductionist consciousness based on the brain .
At the same time , for me and for many others , that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying .
But I go in a different direction .
In the time , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising .
The first idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental bricks , space , time and mass .
It 's fundamental laws that govern it , like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics .
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties do n't explain in terms of no more basic terms .
Instead , they consider themselves fundamental , and that 's where the world is built .
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk> <unk> .
In the 19th century , Maxwell figured out that you ca n't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts of , space , time , mass laws , laws . So I applied the basic laws of electromagnetism , and I applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws govern .
I think that 's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness .
If you ca n't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas , you have , space , time , mass , load , then by a matter of logic , you <unk> the list .
The most natural thing would be <unk> itself as a fundamental brick , a fundamental brick of nature .
This does n't mean that suddenly it 's not the object of science .
It opens up the way to process scientifically .
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts : space , time , mass , physical processes .
The physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can borrow so simple laws that we can in a <unk> .
The situation of consciousness is something like this .
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can borrow so simple laws that we can in a t-shirt .
We still do n't know what laws are , but that 's what we look for .
The second idea is that consciousness can be universal .
Each system can have a degree of consciousness .
This vision is sometimes called <unk> , `` Pan '' for mind , every system is conscious , not only humans , dogs , mice , flies , even the microbes from Rob Knight , the elementary particles .
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness .
The idea is not that photons are smart or you think .
It 's not that a photon can be filled with anguish when he thinks , `` Oh , I always go to the speed of light .
I can never slow down and smell the roses . ''
No , that 's not .
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling , subjective feeling , some primitive precursor of consciousness .
This may sound a little crazy for you .
How would anybody think crazy ?
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is critical .
If it 's fundamental , like space , time and mass , it 's natural to assume that it can also be universal , just like others .
It 's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us <unk> , it 's much less for people in different cultures , where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature .
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process , is <unk> awareness with information .
Whenever there is information processing , there is awareness .
<unk> of complex <unk> , like a human being , complex awareness .
<unk> , simple awareness .
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist , a neuroscientist , <unk> <unk> , took this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with mathematical methods .
It has a mathematical measure of information integration , which is called <unk> , which measures the degree of information integrated into a system .
And it 's supposed to do with consciousness .
So in a human brain , there 's an incredible high degree of information integration , a high degree of <unk> , a high awareness .
In a mouse , there is a very significant degree of information integration , just quite significant , a pretty important degree of consciousness .
But when you get to the worms , microbes , particles , the degree of <unk> will go down .
The level of information integration is lower , but it 's not zero .
In <unk> theory , there will still be a different level of consciousness from scratch .
It actually proposes a fundamental law of consciousness : high degree of <unk> , high degree of consciousness .
Also , another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness into the physical world .
The physicists and the philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract .
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations , but we do n't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom .
As Stephen Hawking 's explaining , `` Where does fire come out ? ''
From vision , the equations of physics can leave you as they are , but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness .
That 's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness .
According to this vision , consciousness is that he puts fire in the equations .
In that vision , consciousness is not out of the physical world as an additive species .
It 's right there at the center .
This vision , I think , <unk> vision , has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature , and it can have social and ethical consequences .
Some can be <unk> .
I used to think that I should n't eat anything to have consciousness , then I had to be vegetarian .
If you 're a <unk> and you accept that vision , you 'll get a lot of hunger .
I think that thinking about it well , this tends to transform your visions , whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral considerations is not both the fact of consciousness , but its importance and complexity .
It 's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems , like computers .
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha 's `` <unk> '' movie ?
Is it conscious ?
According to <unk> information , she has a complicated amount of information processing , integrated , so the answer is yes , if it 's conscious .
If this is right , they come up with really serious ethical issues about the ethics of development of intelligent computers and the <unk> ethic .
And finally , you can ask for the consciousness of full experience , the planet .
Canada has its own consciousness ?
Or to a local level , an integrated group , like the audience at a TED Talk , right now we have a TED collective consciousness , an internal movie for this whole TED group , different from the internal movies in each of the parts ?
I do n't know the answer to that question , but I think at least it 's a question you have to be taking seriously .
So this <unk> vision , it 's a radical vision , and I do n't know if it 's correct .
I 'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea , that consciousness is critical , that the second one , which is universal .
Now vision to ask a lot of questions , many challenges , like , how these little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love .
If we can answer those questions , then I think we 're going through the right path towards serious consciousness .
If not , well , this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy .
We ca n't wait to solve it overnight .
But I think we 'll finally get it to discover it .
Understanding consciousness is the real key , I think , to understand the universe and understand ourselves .
Maybe we just need the right idea .
Thank you .
I grew up in a small rural village to Victoria .
He had a very normal profile , a low profile of education .
I went to school , I sat with my friends , and I was staying with my younger sisters .
It was all very normal .
And when I was 15 years old , a community member came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize .
And my parents said , `` Well , that 's very nice , but there is a clear problem .
She has n't achieved anything . '' And they were right .
I went to school , I had good grades . After the school , I had a low profile on my mother 's <unk> , and I spent a long time looking at the series `` <unk> the <unk> <unk> '' and `` <unk> 's Man . ''
Yes , I know . What contradiction .
But they were right .
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all .
Nothing that can be considered if we take the disability out of the equation .
Years later , I was in the second part of teaching in a high school in Melbourne , just after about 20 minutes in the middle class of legal studies , a guy raised your hand and said , `` Hey , when will I give you your speech ? ''
And I said , `` What talk ? ''
Well , I 'd been talking about the bill of defamation for about good 20 minutes .
And he said , `` You know , your motivational discourse .
When people in the wheelchairs , they talk about <unk> things in school ? ''
`` Usually in the acting classroom . ''
And that was when I realized : This kid had had experiences with disabilities as objects of inspiration .
And we 're not . And it 's not the fault of the guy , that is , that 's true for many of us .
For us , the people with disabilities are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk> .
We are not real people . We are there to inspire .
And , in fact , I 'm on this stage , and I 'm going to tell you what I do in this wheelchair , and you 're probably waiting for you to inspire you . Right ? Yes .
Well , ladies and gentlemen , I 'm afraid I 'm afraid .
I 'm not here for <unk> .
I 'm here to tell you that you 've lied to us relative to disability .
Yes , they 've sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> thing , capital M .
It 's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable .
It 's not a bad thing and it does n't make you remarkable .
And in the last few years , we 've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media .
You may have seen images like this : `` The only disability in life is a bad attitude . ''
Or this one : `` Your excuse is <unk> . ''
Or this one : `` Before I leave , <unk> ! ''
These are just a couple of examples , but there 's a lot of them .
You may have seen one , of the little girl without drawing with a steady pen for the mouth .
You may have seen a child running with <unk> legs of carbon fiber .
And there 's a lot of these images , which are what we call porn inspiration .
And I use the deliberately porn term , because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people .
So in this case , let 's become the disabled of the disabled people .
The purpose of these images is to inspire them , motivate them , so we can be able to see them and think , `` Well , for very bad , that 's my life , it might be worse .
I could be that person . ''
But what if you 're that person ?
I 've lost the number of times I 've been approached by strangers <unk> to express that they think I am courageous or a source of inspiration , and this will happen before my job had a public profile .
It was like me getting up in the morning and remember my own name . And this is <unk> .
These images , those images that are <unk> with disabilities in the benefit of people without disability .
They 're there for you to look at them and think that things are not that bad for you , or to put their concerns in perspective .
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard .
Let me give you some things .
But the things we 're not allowed to do is not the things that you can think of .
They 're not relative things to our bodies .
I use the term `` disabled , '' deliberately because I became a social model of the disability , which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics .
So I 've lived in this body for a long time .
I 'm very <unk> with him .
It makes the things that I need to do , and I 've learned to take the best of your capacity like this , and that 's what happens to the kids of those photos too .
They 're not doing anything outside of the common .
They 're just using their bodies getting the best of their capacity .
So , is it really just <unk> in the way we do , by sharing those images ?
When people say , `` You 're a source of inspiration , '' it says it as a compliment .
And I know why .
It 's because of the lie , because we have sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable .
And honestly , it does n't .
And I know what you 're thinking .
I 'm here <unk> the inspiration , and you think , `` Oh God , <unk> , are you sometimes inspired by something ? ''
And actually , I know that I am .
I learn from other people with disabilities at all time .
However , I do n't learn that I am more lucky than they do .
Now , I 'm learning that it 's a great idea to use a cool idea to collect the things that come up with me , I learn the ingenious trick of how to load the battery on the cell phone on the chair of the chair .
Great .
We learn about the force and resistance of others , not against our bodies and our diagnostics , but against a world that we 're going to <unk> and <unk> us .
I really think that that lie that you 've sold us about disability is the most injustice .
It makes us hard life .
And that quote : `` The only disability in life is a bad attitude , '' the reason that that is a lie is because it 's not true , because of the social model of disability .
A lot of smiles on the stairs has never made it to become a ramp .
Never . <unk> on a television screen , I wo n't get the subtitles for the deaf people .
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and considered a positive attitude to turn all those books to the braille .
It 's just not going to happen .
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl , sitting in his bedroom , watching `` <unk> the <unk> <unk> '' -- it does n't be considered no <unk> for being in a chair .
I want to live in a world where we do n't have so low expectations of people with disabilities that we can be able to get up with the bed and remember our names in the morning .
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities , and I want to live in a world where a <unk> kid in a high school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user .
Disability does n't make us remarkable , but question what you think you know about to know what it does .
Thank you .
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football , with empathy ?
And what is the average speed of a <unk> swallow ?
Unfortunately , I 'll just answer one of those questions , so please do n't get bored .
When people think of augmented reality , they think of `` Minority Report '' and Tom Cruise flying the hands in the air , but the augmented reality is not science fiction .
Augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it , and people need to know that , because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones .
So how do we get to augmented reality ?
The first step , is what I carry : The Google Glass Glass .
I 'm sure many of you are familiar with them .
What you may not know is that Google Glass are a device that lets you see what I see .
It will allow you to experience what a professional athlete is to be a professional athlete .
Right now , the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk> it .
I have to use words .
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination .
We can use Google Glass , under a helmet and knowing what is running through the field of 100 miles per hour , blood beating the ears .
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> us , trying to <unk> it with everything .
I 've been there and I assure you that it 's not nice .
I put some videos to show you what it is to use Google Glass under the helmet , and give you an idea of that .
Unfortunately , it 's not images of NFL practices , because the idea of emerging technology NFL is a submarine up to the surface , but we do what we can .
So let 's look at a video .
Chris <unk> : Come on .
It 's awful .
A moment . <unk> a little bit .
So ?
Go !
Chris <unk> : As you can see , it 's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field , from the perspective of the <unk> .
You may have realized that you need people , the rest of the team .
We have a video of them , <unk> from the University of Washington .
<unk> <unk> : Mice 54 ! <unk> <unk> !
Blue 8 , Blue 8 ! Go !
Chris <unk> : This is a little bit more like the feeling being in the field , but it has nothing to do with being in the NFL .
<unk> want that experience .
The fans want to be in the field , it 's going to be their favorite players , and they 've asked me on YouTube and on Twitter , `` You can see from the angle of a field of the field .
<unk> ?
We want to experience that . ''
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass , how do we get back to the next level ?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> Rift , which surely many of you know .
The Rift Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created , and it 's not cheap <unk> .
And I 'm going to show you why , with this video .
Man : Oh , oh .
No , no , no ! I do n't want to keep playing ! No !
Oh my God ! Oh .
CK : That 's the experience of a man on a rollercoaster in a rollercoaster .
What will be the experience of a fan , when you put a video from Adrian <unk> across the line , <unk> <unk> with the arm before they run and make an notation ? What will be the experience of a fan fan .
When I can be able to run through the court , throw up the ball into the bottom of the network , or would you be able to make a drink in Wimbledon ?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour as an Olympic skier ?
Maybe it was <unk> their infancy sales for adults .
But this is not really augmented reality .
It 's just virtual reality , <unk> .
How do we get augmented reality ?
<unk> reality augmented reality when the coaches , the <unk> and the owners see information that people want to see and think , `` How do we use this to improve our teams ?
How do we use it to win parties ? ''
Because they always use technology to win .
They like to win . It gives you money .
So , here 's a brief refresher on the NFL technology .
In 1965 , the Baltimore 's <unk> put a <unk> on his field <unk> to play faster .
They won the Super Bowl that year .
Other teams decided to animate them .
More people saw the match because it was more exciting , faster .
In 1994 , the NFL , put radios on the <unk> <unk> of the field and then on the defenses .
They had more viewers , because it was faster , more fun .
In <unk> , imagine that they 're a player coming back to your group and see their next show shown in front of you , in a plastic <unk> that they 're wearing . You do n't have to worry about forgetting one .
They or for memorize the strategy .
They just go into the field and they react .
And the coaches want it because if they do n't follow their instructions , they lose party , and they hate losing games .
If you lose parties , you 're going to tell you as a coach .
And they do n't want that .
But augmented reality is not just a manual strategy manual .
Augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game .
How would you do ?
Well , a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view of the people who are down .
You also get information from <unk> sensors and <unk> , something that 's been working on .
And all of that information will send you to your players .
The good teams will be sent .
The bad guys will get information overload .
This is going to get the good teams of bad equipment .
So , your computer team will be as important as your scouts and data analysis will stop being just for nerds .
It will also be for athletes , who would have imagined ?
How would it be in the field ?
Imagine it 's the field of field .
Let 's take the ball and <unk> it .
<unk> an open receptor . All of a sudden , a flashlight on the left side of your bombsight is <unk> that a defense behind you is going to wash up .
It <unk> the area of protection .
Another flashlight , you know , there 's an open receptor .
<unk> the ball , but you 're getting down .
And the ball loses the trajectory .
You do n't know where to land . However , the receptor sees it in its bombsight , an area of grass that lights up and can change the race .
It 's coming up , capture the ball , run and record .
The audience go crazy and fans have been followed by each angle .
This is something to create massive emotion in the party .
I 'm going to do a lot of people see it , because people want to live that experience .
The fans want to be in the field .
They want to be your favorite player .
Augmented reality will be part of the sport because it 's too cost-effective to not be .
But what I ask you is : do we want this to be the only use of augmented reality ?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus , like our usual entertainment ?
Because I think we can use it for something else .
I think we can use augmented reality for empathy between human beings , to show someone what it is , literally , to be in the other person 's place .
We know what this technology is worth of <unk> .
It generates billions of income per year .
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a little bit of how harmful their actions are from the victim 's perspective ?
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how is it being haunted ?
How much is it also worth a <unk> , or a Neil <unk> Neil <unk> , trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes ?
Ladies and gentlemen , augmented reality .
The questions that we make , the decisions we take and the challenges that we face , they depend on as usual , as usual .
Thank you .
I recently retired after 23 years of service in the California <unk> California .
Most of those 23 years , the country was <unk> the southern tip of <unk> County , including the Golden Gate Bridge .
The bridge is an iconic structure , known for its beautiful views of San Francisco , the Pacific Ocean , and its inspiring <unk> .
Unfortunately , it 's also a magnet for suicide , being one of the most used places in the world .
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in 1937 .
Joseph Strauss , an engineer named engineer , to build the bridge , said that , `` The bridge is virtually proof of suicide .
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or likely .
But from his openness , over 1,600 people have jumped to death from that bridge .
Some believe that it 's going to travel between the two towers to bring it to another dimension , this bridge has been idealized as such , so that each of them gives you away from all your concerns and pain , and the waters that go underneath your soul .
But let me tell you that the bridge is used to commit suicide .
After a <unk> of four to five seconds , the body sucks against water about 120 miles an hour .
The impact breaks the bones , some of which will be vital organs .
Most people die in the impact .
The ones that do n't , they 're usually <unk> in the water , and then they drowned .
I do n't think that the ones that we were doing this suicide method will realize the death of the death that they 're going to face .
This is the wire .
Except around the two towers , it 's 32 inches of parallel steel .
This is where most people are in order to take out of life .
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge , and in its darker moment , it 's very hard to bring them back .
I took this picture last year as this young man talked to a mate looking at his life .
I want to tell you with glad that we had success that day to bring it back on the railing .
When I started working on the bridge , we had no formal training .
<unk> to channel the path through these calls .
This was n't just a bad service service to those who were suicide , but the officials .
We 've come a long way since then .
Today , veterans and psychologists trained to train new officials .
This is Jason <unk> .
I met him on July 22 of the last year when he was having a so-called suicidal subject sitting on the <unk> fence .
<unk> , and when I arrived , I looked at Jason talking with an officer of the Golden Gate Bridge .
Jason was just 32 years old and had flown over here from New Jersey .
In fact , I had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge .
After about an hour talking to Jason , we asked if we knew the history of Pandora 's box .
<unk> the Greek mythology , <unk> created Pandora , and sent him to the Earth with a box , and he said , `` Never , never open that box . ''
Well , one day , curiosity could get more than Pandora , and she opened the box .
From her two pests and sorrows and all kinds of evils against man .
The only good thing in the box was hope .
So Jason asked , `` What happens if you open the box and there is no hope ? ''
A few moments , he leaned on the right , and it was .
This kind kind of guy in New Jersey and the New Jersey in New Jersey had just been taken off .
I talked to the parents of Jason at that night , and I suppose when I was talking to them , it did n't seem to be ringing ringing , because the next day , the family 's rabbi called me to see how he was .
The parents of Jason had had to be asked .
<unk> sense of suicide affect a lot of people .
I ask you these questions : What would you do if a member of your family , a friend or someone loved it was suicide ?
What would you say ?
What do you say ?
In my experience , not only have to speak , but you have to listen .
They will hear .
<unk> , or <unk> , or say to the person you know how it feels , because you probably do n't know .
It just being there , you can be the inflection point that you need .
If you think someone is suicidal , you 're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question .
One way to ask you the question is , `` Other people in the similar circumstances have thought of your life to end ; you 've had these thoughts ? ''
<unk> the person in front of it can save the life and will be the turning point for them .
Other signs to look at : despair , I believe that things are terrible and they 're never going to get better -- <unk> , believe that there 's nothing that you can do about it ; social awareness , and a loss of the interest in life .
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago , and I got an email from a lady , and I 'd like to read you your letter .
She lost his son on the 19th of January , this year , and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago , and it 's his permission and blessing that I read .
`` Hi , Kevin . I guess you 're at the TED conference .
It must be a whole experience being there .
I 'm thinking I should go to the bridge this weekend .
I just wanted to leave you a note .
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell their friends and so on .
I 'm still quite insensitive , but noticing even more moments of realizing that Mike will not come home .
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the party of 49 <unk> in his father 's 19 .
It never came there .
I called the <unk> police , and it has reported it as disappeared that night .
The next morning , two officers came to my house and reported that the Mike 's car was down on the bridge .
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before .
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves .
Who has n't been before wrong without suffering from a real mental illness ?
It should n't be so easy to end up with it .
My prayers are with you for your struggle .
The <unk> , the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay , not a cemetery .
Good luck this week , <unk> . ''
I ca n't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and tour the path that his son took that day , and also the courage to go ahead .
I 'd like to introduce you to a man that I 'm talking about with hope and value .
On March 11 of 2005 , I said to a radio call for a possible suicide bomber on the sidewalk sidewalk near the bridge tower .
I 'd put my bike on the sidewalk and looked at this man , Kevin <unk> , standing on the sidewalk .
When he saw me , it crossed immediately the railing , and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower .
Over the course of the hour and a half after , I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and hopelessness .
Kevin decided in his own that day to go back on that lane and give life another opportunity .
When Kevin came back , he <unk> it .
`` This is a new beginning , a new life . ''
But I asked him , `` What was it that he did go back and gave him the hope and another opportunity ? ''
And you know what he said ?
He said , `` I heard you .
They stopped talking and just heard . ''
Shortly after that incident , I got a letter from the mother of Kevin , and I have that letter with me , and I 'd like to <unk> it .
`` Dear Mr. <unk> , I do n't erase the March 11 events , and you 're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us .
I honestly , I think Kevin was <unk> .
It 's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it 's been properly <unk> .
She took to Kevin when I only had six months , completely unconscious from all of those traits , but , thank God , now we know .
Kevin is in order , Kevin is in order .
We thank God for you .
I <unk> <unk> . ''
And at the end she writes , `` <unk> . When I went to San Francisco 's Hospital , that night , you were <unk> like the patient .
`` Wow , I had to solve it ! ''
Today , Kevin is a loving father and an active member of society .
It talks openly about the events of that day and of his depression with the hope that his story inspire others .
suicide is not just something that I 've found in work .
It 's personal .
My grandfather killed himself with poison .
That act , despite the end of his own pain , robbery the opportunity to meet me .
This is what about suicide .
For most people to be suicidal , or those who consider suicide , they would n't think they hurt another person .
They just want their own pain .
It 's usually achieved by three ways : sleep , drugs or alcohol or death .
In my career , I 've responded and I 've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and whale calls around the bridge .
Out of those incidents I 've been directly involved with , I 've only lost two , but those two are too much .
One was Jason .
The other was a man who talked to him about an hour .
During that time , I <unk> my hand on three occasions .
At the end of the end , he looked at me , and he said , `` Kevin , I 'm sorry , but I have to go . ''
And I jumped .
Awful , absolutely horrible .
I want to tell you , though , that the vast majority of people who we get to contact with that bridge is not suicide .
Also , those few people who have jumped out of the bridge and lived , and that you can talk about it , that one or two percent , most of those people have said that the second they leave on side the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live .
I tell people , the bridge does n't just connect <unk> with San Francisco , but also people .
That connection , or a bridge that we do , is something that everyone and every one of us should be used to do .
suicide can prevent .
There 's help . There 's hope .
Thank you very much .
The world makes you be what you 're not , but in your interior , you know what you are , and a question you mark : How do you become that ?
I have to be something unique in that sense , but I 'm not alone , no way I 'm alone .
When I became a model , I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had since I was a child .
My outside , finally <unk> with my inner truth , with my inner self .
So , for reasons , I 'm going to go later on , when I look at this picture , I think , `` You did n't get it <unk> , you got it , you got .
But last October , I discovered that I 'm just starting .
We all become our families , our religion , our society , our moment in history , even our bodies .
Some of them have the value of free , to get rid of the limitations of the skin or by the beliefs that surround us .
These are people who are always challenging the status quo , which is considered accepted .
In my case , the last nine years , many of my neighbors , many of my friends , my agent , even ignored my story .
I think this puzzle is called revelation .
This is mine .
I was recorded as `` boy '' at birth because of the appearance of my genitals .
I remember in my five years in the Philippines , I was always wearing this t-shirt in my head .
And my mom asked me , `` Why do you always take that t-shirt in your head ? ''
I said , `` Mom , it 's my hair . I 'm a girl . ''
I knew then how to do it .
The gender has always been considered a unchanging fact , but now we know that it 's something more complex and mysterious .
Because of my success , I never gave myself to share my story , not because I thought I 'm going to be what I 'm wrong , but how the world is trying to get to free .
Every day I 'm grateful to be a woman .
I have a mom , my dad and a family who will take me as I am .
Many are not so fortunate .
There 's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender .
There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion .
There 's a Hindu goddess of <unk> .
And when I was eight , I was at a party in the Philippines of these mysteries .
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came up to me , and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me : This is the kind of woman I wanted to be .
And when I was 15 , when I still wore a man , I met this woman called <unk> .
It 's the principal of a transgender beauty contest .
That night she asked me , `` Why have n't you involved in the beauty competition ? ''
He told me that if she did , she was responsible for the Club and the costumes . And that night , I won in bathroom suit , and he won a third finalist among over 40 candidates .
That moment changed my life .
Suddenly , I was inside the world of beauty <unk> .
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was the queen of beauty of transgender women , but I can .
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when we traveled to the remote provinces of the Philippines .
But more importantly , I met my best friends in that community .
In 2001 , my mom was moved to San Francisco , he called me and told me that they passed my request from the green card that I could go to the United States .
I was resistant .
I told my mother , `` Mommy , I 'm having fun .
I 'm here with friends , I like to travel and be a queen of beauty . ''
But then , two weeks later , he called me and said , `` You know , if you voice the United States , you can change your name and your gender identity ? ''
It was all I needed to hear .
My mom suggested to give me two `` and '' to my name .
She also accompanied me when I had surgery in Thailand at the age of 19 .
It 's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most <unk> , sophisticated surgeries .
At that time in the U.S. , it was necessary to be done before the name of the name and the gender .
So , in 2001 , I went to San Francisco , and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and `` F 's gender . ''
It was a great moment .
For some people , their identity document means power or being able to get a drink , but to me was the license to live , to feel worthy .
Suddenly my fears were <unk> .
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York , and to be a model .
Many are not so fortunate .
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A young woman from New York City who was living his truth , but he <unk> , he turned to his life .
For many of my community , that 's the reality that they live in .
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population .
All of November 20 , we do a global vigil by <unk> <unk> .
I 'm on this stage because of a long history of people who were <unk> and stood up to injustice .
These are Fernando P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk> .
Today , right now , I 'm coming out of the closet .
I ca n't keep living my truth and just for me .
I want to do best to help others live their truth without shame , not fear .
I 'm here , <unk> , so that one day there was no more than 20 than November 20 .
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am .
Will you do it ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you , thank you . Kathryn Schulz : <unk> , a quick question .
<unk> <unk> : Sure . You see , first , thank you all my blessings .
To my support network , my parents , especially to my family , who is very strong .
I remember all the time I 've been to a trans young women who I 've been on , and sometimes , when I was called me and told me that their parents could not accept it , I took the phone , called my mom and say , `` Mommy , can you call this woman ? ''
Sometimes it worked , others are n't . It 's just gender identity , that 's what 's at the center of what we are , right ?
I mean , we were assigned to a gender at birth , and what I 'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that <unk> assignment , and that there should be a space that would allow people to participate , and this is a conversation that we should have with parents , with colleagues .
The transgender movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement .
There 's still a lot of work to do .
I should have understanding .
There should be room for curiosity and ask questions , and I hope that all of you are my allies .
KS : Thank you . Very nice . <unk> : Thank you .
In many , most patriarchal and tribal societies , the parents usually meet them for their children , but I 'm one of the few parents who 's known for her daughter and I 'm proud of it .
<unk> started his campaign by education in 2007 in 2007 , and when he was <unk> up his efforts in 2011 , by <unk> the National Security Prize for peace , he was very famous , a very popular girl in her country .
Before that , I was my daughter , but now I 'm his father .
Ladies and gentlemen , if you take a look at the history of mankind , the story of women is the story of the injustice of inequality , of inequality and the exploitation .
You see , in patriarchal societies , right from the beginning , when when you 're born a child , your birth do n't celebrate .
It 's not welcome , and it 's not welcome by your father , or for your mother .
The neighborhood comes , day their <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father .
And a mother drives a lot to have a child .
When you give birth to the first child , the first child , it gets sad .
When it gives birth to the second daughter , he was <unk> , and with the hope of a son , when he shines his third daughter , she feels guilty as a criminal .
Not only mother suffers , but the daughter was newly born , when she grows , she suffers .
At the age of five , when I should go to school , you stay at home and the school admits of your siblings .
At the age of 12 , in a way , it has a good life .
You can have fun .
He can play with his friends on the street , and he can move around the streets as a butterfly .
But when it comes into adolescence , when it 's 13 years old , it 's been laughing at home without a male <unk> .
It 's confined to the four walls of your house .
It 's not a free person anymore .
It becomes the honor of his father and her brothers and his family and his family , and if he was <unk> the code of that assumption , he could even kill .
And it 's interesting that this assumption of honor code , not only does the life of a girl 's life , also affects the life of the family members of the family .
So this brother , <unk> the joys of life and the happiness of his sisters on behalf of the honor of the honor .
And there is a norm of most patriarchal societies called obedience .
It 's supposed to be a good girl should be very quiet , very humble and very <unk> .
It 's the criteria .
The model of a good girl must be <unk> .
It 's supposed to be silent and <unk> the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly , even if they do n't want .
If you marry them with a man who does n't like or if you marry it with an old man , it has to embrace it , because you do n't want to be <unk> .
If you do very young marry , you have to embrace it .
Otherwise , <unk> <unk> .
And what happens at the end ?
In words of a poet : `` marry , the <unk> , and then it gives birth to more sons and daughters . ''
And the irony of the situation is that this mother , <unk> the same lesson of obedience to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to her children .
And this vicious circle continues and continues .
<unk> brothers and sisters , when I was born <unk> , and for the first time , believe me , I do n't like newborns , to be honest , but when I was there and I looked at his eyes , believe me , I was extremely honored .
And so much before I was born , I thought about his name , and fascinated with a <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan .
His name was <unk> de <unk> , and he called my daughter like that .
But when I looked , they were all men , and I grabbed my pen , and I plotted a line of my name , and I wrote , `` <unk> . ''
And when she grew up , when she was four and a half years old , I <unk> it in my school .
You may ask , why should I mention the admission of a child in a school ?
Yes , I must have mentioned that .
You can take it for granted in Canada , in the United States , in many developed countries , but in the poor countries , in the societies , in the tribal societies , is a great event for a child 's life .
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name .
One admission to school means that he has entered the world of dreams and aspirations that can explore their potential for their future life .
I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and they would be surprised , two weeks before , when I was <unk> the Canadian visa , and it was in the relative part of the family , I could n't remember the family members of some of my sisters .
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my former writing in any document .
That was why I value my daughter .
What my father could not give my sisters or their daughters , I thought I had to change it .
I used to appreciate intelligence and <unk> of my daughter .
I 'm going to sit down to sit with me when my friends came to see me .
The encouraged to go with me different meetings .
And all of these values , I 've tried to deal with her personality .
And this was not just for her , just to <unk> .
Now , all of these good values in my school and girls alike .
I used the education for the emancipation .
I taught my daughters , I taught students , to forget the lesson of the obedience .
I taught students to forget the lesson called <unk> .
<unk> brothers and sisters , fought for more rights for women , and we fought to have more and more space for women in society .
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon .
It was lethal for human rights , and in particular , for women 's rights .
It was called <unk> .
That means a complete denial of women 's participation in all the political and economic activities .
Hundreds of schools were lost .
The girls were banned to go to school .
The women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to markets .
The musicians were silenced , the <unk> girls and the singers were killed .
<unk> millions , but a few talked about it , and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about your rights .
It 's really terrifying .
The 10 years old , <unk> stood up and got up because of the right to education .
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog , she was offered herself to the New York Times documentaries , and I talked about every platform that he could .
And his voice was the most powerful voice .
It 's <unk> like a <unk> worldwide .
And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and October nine of October 2012 , he was shot in the head .
It was a <unk> day for my family and me .
The world became a great black hole .
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death , I whispered it into my wife , `` Should I get to me for my daughter , to your daughter ? ''
And <unk> said to me , `` Please , do n't get you .
They <unk> the right cause .
<unk> your life in play because of the truth , for the cause of peace , and because of education , and your daughter was inspired by you and joined you together .
They were both on the right path and God will protect . ''
These very few words I 'd been a lot for me , and I did n't go back to ask again .
When I was in the hospital , and I had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut , I used to see a dark shadow that was stripped through my wife 's face .
But my daughter never complained .
I used to say , `` I 'm fine with my smile , meet the <unk> in my face .
I 'm going to be good . Please do n't worry . ''
It was a comfort for us , and we were <unk> .
<unk> brothers and sisters , we 've learned from her how to resist in the harder moments , and I 'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children 's rights and women , it 's like any <unk> girl .
<unk> when it does n't end .
They fight with his siblings , and I 'm very happy for that .
People ask me , `` What about special on my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave , expressive and <unk> ? ''
I 'm telling you , do n't ask me what I did .
I did n't know what I did .
I did n't cut their wings and that 's all .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago , and since that day , the science of the brain has become a personal passion .
I 'm engineering .
And I want to tell you that I 've recently joined the <unk> group of Google , where I 've had a <unk> to my seat , the <unk> of Google <unk> , but the whole work I 'm talking about here today about the science of the brain , I did before I join Google or outside of my work there .
Having said this , there 's a stigma when you get to a brain operation .
Are you still being smart or not ?
Would n't you be able to be able to be smart ?
After neurosurgery , I was missing a part of the brain , and I had to live with it .
It was n't the gray matter , but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates that is important hormones and neurotransmitters .
And immediately after the operation , I had to decide how much to take , about a dozen powerful chemicals every day , because if I did n't take anything , I would die in a few hours .
Every day , for the last 18 years , I 've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals , and try to get it , to follow life .
More than once I 've been saved .
But luckily , I 've got a soul of <unk> , so I decided I 'll do it to try to get the dose dose , because there 's no clear map that says it in <unk> .
I started to test with different mixes , and I was surprised by seeing how small changes in the dose changed my <unk> , my sense of who I was , my way of thinking , my behavior with others .
A particularly impressive case : for a few months , I took a dose and chemical doses for a <unk> man , and I was surprised to see how my thoughts changed .
I was always angry , I thought all the time in sex , and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world , and -- of course , many times in the past , I 've known a number of different types , or maybe some versions of it .
It turned out to be an extreme .
But my big surprise was that I was n't trying to be arrogant .
In fact , I was trying , very insecure , fix a problem that was in the front , and just did n't happen .
So I could n't handle it .
I changed my dose .
But , I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men about men and about what they have to go through , and since then I 'm getting better with men .
What I was trying to do is that we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on , it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the operation , my creative thinking , my flow of ideas .
I 'm thinking almost always in images , and that became my key point point : how to get those mental images I 'm using to create <unk> , my ideas , if you want , it understands new ideas and <unk> situations .
This kind of thinking is not new .
<unk> like Hume , Descartes and Hobbes , see things similarly .
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing .
Now , there are the people asking this idea , and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works . For me it 's simple : for most of us , mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and inventive .
So after several years , I 'm able to find the point right , and I 've got a lot of great mental <unk> , really <unk> , sophisticated and <unk> .
Now , I 'm working on how to make these mental images quickly , from my mind to the computer screen .
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use their imagination only to direct the world that has the front ?
Or if a musician could extract the music from his head ?
There are amazing possibilities with this , like the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light .
And the truth is , the only difficulty in order to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems .
Let me show you why I think we 're pretty close to this with two recent experiments done by two recent experiments in neuroscience .
Both of the MRI used MRI , image of functional MRI , to represent the brain , and here you can see the brain scanning that 's done by <unk> <unk> and his Harvard colleagues .
The column on the left shows you the brain scanning of a person who looks at an image .
The middle column show the brain scanning that same individual as it imagined , seeing that same image .
The column on the right is created from the central column from the left column on the left . You see that the difference is almost zero-sum .
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images , always with a similar outcome .
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk> .
Now , let me share with you another experiment . This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley , California .
They were able to turn the brainwaves into visual fields .
Let 's put it this way .
In this experiment , it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as their brains were <unk> to create a huge pool of reaction from the brain to video sequences .
Then , I showed you a film with new images , new people , new animals , and as you get a new scanning .
The computer , using just the brain information of the scanning , to show you what seemed like the person was seeing .
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer , and on the left , the video I showed you .
This blew up .
We 're okay to do that .
We just need to improve resolution .
And now , remember , when you see an image , and when you imagine that same image , it 's created in the brain the same mapping .
This is done with the brain scanning systems of higher resolution available today , and their resolution is increased as a thousand times in the last few years .
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look .
How did we do that ?
There are many techniques to do that .
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes .
I do n't offer for that .
Many of you are proposing new techniques of projection imaging , even me . Tell us with the recent outcome of the MRI , first we have to ask the next thing , this technology will be the end of the road ?
Now , conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with larger magnets , but at this point , the more <unk> magnets only offer little improvements in resolution , not for thousands as we need .
I propose this idea : instead of bigger magnets , let 's make better magnets .
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements , like making a <unk> .
And why do we care ?
Over the last few years , a lot of <unk> effort were to make really big magnets , right ?
But most of the recent advances in the <unk> of ingenious , clever , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> radio transmitters in the MRI system .
At the same time , instead of a uniform field , we use the <unk> patterns and <unk> by the FM radio frequencies .
So by combining magnetic patterns with the FM patterns patterns of FM radio patterns , we can dramatically increase the information that you can take in a single scan .
In addition , we can then divide our growing knowledge of our brain structure and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need .
By using fMRI technology , we should be able to measure not just the blood of blood <unk> , but the hormones and the <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity . This is sleep .
We be able to put our ideas into direct media to the digital media .
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through thinking ?
What would we be able to ?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter ?
You thought the Internet is big .
These are great questions .
It would be compelling to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills .
Certainly , this same tool could bring to the cure for Alzheimer 's and similar diseases .
We have a few more choices to open this door .
So anyway , pick a year , will happen in five or 15 years ?
It 's hard to imagine it will take much more .
We need to learn how to take this step together .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet , and not just in a traditional sense , not just the gay closet .
I think we all have cabinets .
Your closet may be telling some person for the first time you love her or tell someone who 's pregnant , or tell someone who has cancer , or any other hard conversation that you 've gone through in life .
It 's a tough conversation , and even though our subjects can vary tremendously , the experience of I 've lived in , and there 's a little universal conversation .
It 's scary , and we do n't like it , and it must happen .
Many years ago , I was working in the South Side Side <unk> <unk> , a restaurant in the city , and I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> : not <unk> my armpits , quote the letters of <unk> mammography as a litany .
And it 's going to be slope by the <unk> of my short pants , and I 'd put my head up to my head , and I was usually asked , `` Hey , are you a kid or girl ? ''
And there would be a quiet silence on the table .
I slept my jaw a little bit more , I would take my coffee with me with anger .
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper , and the mother was launched a cold to his son .
But I would n't say anything , and I put it inside .
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old , I was ready to fight .
And that 's a terrible feeling .
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something .
It would be that hard conversation .
So after a few weeks , it happened again .
`` You 're a boy or a girl ? ''
A familiar silence , but this time I was ready , and I was about to get into the female affairs at the table . I had the quotes from Betty <unk> .
Gloria Steinem .
Even a fragment of the `` Vagina Monologues '' that would show .
So I took a deep breath , and I went down and on my back , a <unk> girl with a pink dress , staring at what 's not a challenge for a <unk> feminist , just a girl with a question , `` You 're a kid or girl ? ''
So I took a deep breath again , and I got a lot of a lot back to her , and I said , `` Hey , I know this is confusing .
I have the short hair like the one of a guy , and I 'm a girl , and I 'm a girl , and you know , as you like to use a pink dress , and sometimes you like to use a pink pajamas .
All right , I 'm more of the kind of girl in a comfortable pajamas . ''
And that girl looked at me at me , paying attention , and said , `` My favorite pajamas is purple and it 's got a fish .
Can you give me a <unk> , please ? ''
And that was it . Just `` Oh , you 're a girl .
What about the <unk> that I asked ? ''
It was the most easy conversation ever ever had .
And why ? Because the girl in <unk> and me , both of us , we were honest with the other .
So as many of us , I 've lived in some illusions in my life , and yes , often my walls used to be a rainbows .
But in the dark , you ca n't know what color are the walls .
You just know how one feels like living in a closet .
It 's like my closet is not different from yours or to yours or yours .
Surely , I 'll give you a hundred reasons why I get out of my closet was harder than coming out of my closet , but this is the issue : the hard thing is not relative .
The hard thing is hard .
Who can tell me to explain to somebody who has declared on broken banking , is harder than to tell you that it 's been fooled ?
Who can tell me that this story is harder than to say to your five-year-old who will be divorced ?
There 's no more difficult thing , there 's only how hard it is .
We need to stop classifying what 's hard for us to do with it , which is hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closet , and we need to just feel empathy because we all live in something difficult .
At some point in our lives , we all live in cabinets , and they can make them feel secure , or at least security than the other side of the door offers .
But I 'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made , a closet , is not a place to live .
Thank you . Imagine themselves 20 years ago .
I had a horse tail , a <unk> dress and shoes .
He was not militant lesbian ready to fight against any three-year-old child who would fit into coffee .
It was frozen for the fear , <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay grenade , and the moving only muscle is the scariest thing I ever ever did .
My family , my friends , complete strangers who I 've spent my entire life trying to do n't disappoint , and now the world would turn around to purpose .
He was burning the pages of a script that we 've all been followed by so long , but if you do n't launch that grenade , kill you .
One of my most memorable launches was at my sister 's wedding .
It was the first time that many among the guests knew that I was gay , and when my Lady of honor lady , in my black dress and heels , walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and finally came to one where my parents ' friends were known to me , people who were known to me .
And after talking a moment , one of the women shouted , `` I love Nathan Lane ! ''
And the battle of gay storytelling had started .
`` Did you ever get in the Castro ? ''
`` Well yes , the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco . ''
`` Well , we 've never gone there , but we 've heard that it 's fabulous . ''
`` <unk> , you know my <unk> Antony ? ''
It 's very good , and you 've never talked about having a girlfriend . ''
`` <unk> , what is your favorite TV program ?
Our favorite program ? Will and Grace .
And you know who we love ? Jack .
Jack is our favorite . ''
And then a woman , <unk> , but she 's waiting to show her support , to get me to know that he was on my side , finally he said abruptly `` Well , sometimes my husband uses pink shirts . ''
And I had an opportunity at that moment , like all the launch launchers .
Surely , it might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk> .
It 's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk> .
And what else can you ask for somebody , but to work ?
If you 're going to be authentic with somebody , you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you get .
That 's how hard conversations are still without being my strong point .
Ask anyone who I have left .
But I 'm getting better , and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk> .
Now , please look at this through gay perspective , but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same .
Number one : Be authentic .
<unk> armor . Be you .
That child in coffee did n't have armor , but I was ready for the battle .
If you want somebody to be genuine , others must know we also suffer .
Number two : Be a direct . <unk> your patches .
If you know they 're gay , <unk> .
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay , they will maintain the hope that that could change .
They will not give them a sense of false hope .
And number three , and more importantly , if you 're complex .
You communicate your truth .
You can never get rid of that .
And some of them can get safe wounded , <unk> for what they 've done , but it 's never sorry for what they are .
And yes , maybe some people might be disappointed , but that 's something in them , not you .
Those are expectations of them that you are , but not your own .
That 's the story of them , but not from you .
The only story that matters is that you want to write .
So the next time you find it in a very dark , <unk> little grenade , you must know that we 've all been there before .
And it may be very lonely , but they 're not .
Thank you , Boulder . Enjoy the evening .
Intelligence , what is that ?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has been seen , a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that `` The <unk> of the machine can think of it as interesting as the submarine if a submarine can swim . ''
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique of the pioneers of computer pioneers as Alan Turing .
And so a few years ago , I took a program to try and understand the fundamental core mechanisms underlying intelligence .
Let 's take a step back .
First start with a mental experiment .
Imagine that they 're from an alien race , that you do n't know anything about the biology of the Earth nor the neuroscience of the Earth nor have incredible telescopes , and you can look at Earth , and they have incredibly long lives , so you can look at the Earth for millions , even billions of years .
And you see a very strange effect .
Of course , like Earthlings , we know that it would be that we 're trying to save ourselves .
We 're trying to avoid an impact .
But if you 're from an alien race that does n't know anything about this , that it does n't have any concept on Earth 's intelligence , it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how , up to a certain time in time , the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet mysteriously stops doing .
And so I claim that this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence .
So in this program that I did several years ago , I studied a variety of subjects through science , through various disciplines , which pointed , I think , towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence .
In cosmology , for example , there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be honed carefully for the development of intelligence , and in particular , for universals of universal states that will promote the diversity of possible future .
Finally , in robotic motion planning , there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the ability of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks .
And so , taking all these different subjects and <unk> them together , asked , for several years now : Is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different subjects ?
Is there just an equation for intelligence ?
And I think the answer is . What you 're looking at is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I 've seen .
So what you 're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a force , F , that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action .
It acts for maximize the future freedom of action , or keeping the choices open , with an <unk> force , with the diversity of possible future accessible , yes , to an imminent time , tau .
In a nutshell , intelligence does n't like it .
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping options open .
And so , having in account this equation , it 's natural to ask : What can you do with this ?
How predictive is it ?
Do you have the level of human intelligence ?
Will we have artificial intelligence ?
So I 'm going to show you now a video that I think , and I 'm going to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation .
Narrator : <unk> research in cosmology , they have suggested that universes that produce more disorder , or `` entropy , '' in their life , they should have the trend for more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us .
But what if that cosmological <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence would make a deeper relationship ?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term , but actually arises from it ?
To find out , we 've developed a software engine called <unk> , designed to maximize the production of the long-term entropy in any system that you find in .
Remarkably , <unk> could pass multiple animal intelligence tests , play humans games , and even winning money by making actions , all of that without being told to do that .
Here are some examples of <unk> in action .
Like a <unk> man without falling over , here we see <unk> <unk> , automatically , a pole using a cart .
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal .
It just decided for his own balancing pole .
This ability to balance balance will have applications for the humanoid robotics and technologies .
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture .
Also , just like some other animals can cooperate by pull opposite ends of a string at the same time to release the food , here we see that you can make a version of the model of that task .
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields .
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of domains .
For example , here we see successfully playing a pong game game against itself , <unk> their potential for play .
Here we see , we 're going to try to orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly standing and keeps the net well connected .
This same <unk> capacity also has applications on health care , energy and intelligence .
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships , discovering successfully , and using the Panama Canal to extend the global scope of the Atlantic to the Pacific .
In the same way , <unk> is largely applicable in defense , logistics and transportation .
Finally , here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy , <unk> in a simulated series of shares , successfully increasing assets under its management .
That risk management ability will have huge applications in finance and safe .
Alex <unk> : What you 've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools , walking walking and social cooperation , they all derive from one equation that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action .
Now , here 's a deep irony .
Let 's go back to the very beginning of the use of the term robot , the work `` <unk> '' -- there was always the concept that if you were smart machines , there would be cyber rebellion .
The machines looked up against us .
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades , we 've had all the concept of cyber rebellion in the reverse .
It 's not that machines first become smart , and then they 're going to try to take over the world .
It 's all the opposite , that the impulse to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence can actually arise out directly from taking control , instead of being backwards .
Another important implication is the pursuit of the target .
I often ask me , `` How do you look for targets off of this kind of framework ? ''
My equivalent to that statement to move through the descendants to build artificial intelligences or to help them to understand human intelligence , is the following : intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions on their own future .
Thank you very much .
We 're at a turning point in human history , something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet we call home .
Although , in the last few years , we 've expanded very much our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe .
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit other stars , which points to Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy .
Kepler is a space telescope that measures faint light intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them , and blocking a little bit of that light that comes to us .
The data picked up by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that are between them and their stem star .
And together , this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the planets in our solar system , and also the amount of light they get from their suns .
Instead , this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not .
Unfortunately , as we find this treasure of worlds potentially livable , our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity .
The 2014 year was the largest recorded .
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades .
These environmental changes that we have caused global scale have changed our ability to change their course .
But I 'm not a weather scientist , no astronomer .
I study the Goldilocks on the planet being influenced by the stars , with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet .
I mean , I 'm looking for alien opportunities in the housing industry .
Now , as a very interested person in the search for life in the universe , I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to Earth , more enjoy our own planet .
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better : the ones of our solar system .
Take our neighbor , Mars .
Mars is tiny and <unk> , and even though it 's a little further from the sun , it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated by a mission like Kepler .
In fact , it 's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past , and in part , it 's why we studied both on Mars .
Our <unk> like the Curiosity `` Curiosity '' track its surface in pursuit of the origins of life as we know it .
The satellites that orbit , like the <unk> of the <unk> , take samples of the atmosphere of Mars , and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose your Goldilocks .
<unk> companies are now not only short space flights , but also the tantalizing possibility of living on Mars .
But despite all these images , <unk> remind us of the deserts of our planet , places that are linked to our imagination with the <unk> and groundbreaking ideas , compared to Earth , Mars is a pretty terrible place to live .
Let 's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still have to colonize them , places that are really <unk> compared to Mars .
Even in the most dry , tallest places on Earth , the air is fresh and full of oxygen that we have in our tropical forests on thousands of miles away .
I 'm worried about this excitement for the colonization of Mars , and other planets are holding with a big , sad shadow : the implication and the belief in some of Mars that Mars would expect to save us from the only planet <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable , the Earth .
Just as I like the interplanetary exploration , I 'm deep disagree with this idea .
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars , but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is like to imagine that the captain of the Titanic is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will actually have place later in the life boats . Thank you .
But the targets for the interplanetary exploration , and it 's not <unk> .
No , they 're actually faces of the same coin : the goal of understanding and preserve and better life in the future .
The extreme environments in our world look look like aliens .
They just get closer home .
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces , in the hostile and inhospitable areas of the land , maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that .
I 'll leave you with a thought experiment : the paradox of Fermi .
A lot of years ago , Enrico Fermi , the Enrico Fermi asked himself , to notice that our universe has been around for a long time , and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe , we should have found evidence of existence of extraterrestrial life so far .
Well , where are they ?
Well , one possible solution to Fermi 's paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to continue to live in between the stars , they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that are developing this development .
It 's arrogant to think that only the interplanetary colonization will save us from ourselves , but the planetary preservation and the interplanetary exploration can work together .
If we really believe in our ability to bring to the hostile environments of Mars for human presence , then we should be able to overcome the most easy task to preserve the Goldilocks on Earth .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I <unk> my own house .
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets , I realized I did n't have the keys .
In fact , I could see by the window that they were at the dining table , where he had left them .
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows , and they were all fine .
I thought about calling a <unk> , at least I had my cell phone , but at midnight , a <unk> could take a long time to get it , and I was cold .
I could n't go back home from my friend 's friend to pass on night , because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning , and I <unk> my passport and my suitcase .
<unk> expensive , but sure it 's not more expensive than a <unk> at night , so I thought , despite the circumstances , I 'd been standing room .
I 'm a profession , and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress .
<unk> cortisol that increases heart rate , <unk> the rush rate and <unk> thinking .
And when I got to the turnover counter at the airport , I realized I did n't have my passport .
Well , I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleeping .
And I started to wonder , if there was something that I could do , systems that could put in place , that will avoid bad things happening .
Or , at least , if bad things happen , that will give you the probability that it 's a total catastrophe .
So I started thinking about that , but until a month later my thoughts .
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> , the Nobel Prize winner , and a little bit embarrassed by the Nobel Prize , and a little embarrassed him , I had forgotten my passport , and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called retrospective .
It 's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written this a few years before , known as the <unk> .
You all know what the <unk> is .
Every time there 's a disaster , a experts of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong , right ?
In <unk> , like Danny 's explaining to Danny , you look forward and trying to figure out all the things that could go wrong , then you try to figure out what can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize the damage .
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk> .
Some of them are evident , others are not so obvious .
I 'm going to start with the obvious .
And in the house , they 'll take a place for things that are easily lost .
Now this sounds common , and it is , but there 's a lot of science that supports this thesis , based on how our spatial memory works .
There 's a structure in the brain called hippocampus , which has evolved over thousands of years , to track the important things , where the good , where the fish are , that places like <unk> trees , where the tribes are in female and enemies .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that 's going on in <unk> <unk> .
It 's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment , they cut out the <unk> sense of squirrels , and they could still find their nuts .
They were not using smell , but the hippocampus , that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things .
But it 's really good for things that do n't move much , not so good for things that move a lot .
This is the reason for losing your car keys , reading glasses and passports .
So in the house , it 's a place for the keys , a hook next to the door , maybe a decorative dish .
For your passport , a particular crate .
For his reading glasses , a particular coffee table .
If you take a place , and you 're <unk> with it , you 'll always be there when you look for them .
What about the trips ?
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards , license driving , passport , <unk> by mail to be in the cloud .
If these things are lost or steal them , this can make substitution .
These are some of the most obvious things .
Remember , when you 're under stress , your brain releases cortisol .
<unk> is toxic and <unk> .
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time , and you have to put systems on your site .
And there are perhaps not more stressful situations that when you 're faced with a medical decision .
And at some point , we will all be in that situation , to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care care , or one loved one , to help them with a decision .
And so I want to talk about that .
And I 'll talk about a very particular medical condition .
But it would be <unk> like a <unk> for medical decisions , and in fact , for the decision making financial decisions and social decisions , any kind of decision that we have to take from that we would benefit a rational assessment of the facts .
So let 's suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says , `` I received the search result and the cholesterol is a little high . ''
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease , heart attack , stroke .
So you 're thinking that you have high cholesterol is not the best , then your doctor says , `` I 'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce your cholesterol , a <unk> . ''
And maybe you 've heard about <unk> , and you know that it 's one of the most prescribed drugs in the world today , and they 're even likely to know people who take them .
So you think , `` Yes , you 're going to hold your <unk> ! ''
But there 's a question that you have to do then , a statistic that you should ask for the most physicians do n't want to talk about , and pharmaceutical companies even less .
It 's for <unk> , the number needs to treat .
And what is this , <unk> ?
It 's the number of people who have to take a drug or to keep surgery in any medical procedure before it 's going to help a person .
And should you think about what kind of statistic <unk> is that ?
The number must be one .
My doctor was not going to give me something if I was n't to help me .
But actually , medical practice does n't work like this .
And it 's not the doctor 's fault , and if it 's someone 's guilt , it 's scientists like me .
We have n't understood very well the underlying mechanisms .
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs are working only from 30 to 50 percent of people .
So the number need to treat the <unk> <unk> , what do you think it is ?
How many people have to take it before you help a person ?
300 .
This is based on the research of cynics <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I just explored the numbers .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack , stroke or another clinically adverse event .
Now maybe you think , `` Well , one probability in 300 to lower my cholesterol .
Why not , doctor ? Get the recipe anyway . ''
But then you have to ask for a bigger statistic , and it is , `` <unk> of the side effects . Right ?
For this particular drug , the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients .
And those include terrible things : <unk> pain and articulate , <unk> pain , but now they think , `` Five percent are not quite likely to happen to me , still take medicine . ''
But a moment .
Remember , low stress do n't think of it .
So let 's think about how to do this over time , so you do n't have to make the process of reasoning in the act .
300 people take the drug , not ? A person has helped , five percent of the 300 have side effects , that 's 15 people .
You have 15 times more likely to get damage to the drug that can help you .
I do n't say they should or not to take the <unk> .
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor .
The medical ethic requires , it 's part of the beginning of informed consent .
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not .
You may be thinking that I 've launched this number in the air for the crash value , but actually this number needs to treat is quite typical .
For the surgery that we 're more done in the older men in the 1950s , <unk> prostate prostate cancer , number need to treat is 49 .
This is , 49 surgeries for a person who has helped .
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients .
Those include helplessness or erectile dysfunction , incontinence incontinence , <unk> rectal , fecal incontinence .
And if you 're lucky , and it 's one of that 50 percent of the effects only one year or two .
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you might argue that you can make the conversation forward .
You do n't have to make all of this in the act .
And they also want to think about quality of life .
Because you have a choice for a lot of times , do you want a shorter life of pain , or longer life that could have much pain to the end ?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now , with their family and their loved ones .
You can change your opinion in the heat of the moment , but at least you 're trained in this kind of thinking .
Remember , our brain releases cortisol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems turn out .
There 's an evolutionary reason for this .
<unk> Face with a predator , you do n't need the digestive system , or the libido or the immune system , because if your body is spending metabolism on those things , it does n't react to fast . You could get the lunch for lions , so none of that matters .
Unfortunately , one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical logical thought , like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown .
So we have to train them to think about the future to this kind of situations .
I think what 's important here is to recognize that we are all rejects .
We 're all going to fail once .
The idea is to think about the future how those failures might be , to put the systems in the place that will help minimize the harm , or to prevent the bad things to happen in the first place .
<unk> at night in Montreal , when I came back from my journey , my contractor installed a lock of combination along the door , with a key to the entry door in the same , an easy way to remember it .
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters I have n't ordered , and lots of email I have n't read .
So I 'm not very organized , but I see the organization like a gradual process , and I 'm doing it .
Thank you very much .
Interpreter : <unk> , `` <unk> '' is my favorite musical symbol .
It means <unk> .
If you 're playing a musical instrument , and you see a <unk> in the score , you need to touch it .
Two <unk> , even more soft .
Four <unk> , extremely smooth .
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree , and there it is that it does n't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> , there can be never <unk> a complete silence .
That 's my definition of silence : a very dark sound .
I 'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs , the <unk> , in addition to a little bit of my own story .
The French signs came over the decade of the 1800s , and over the time , it mixed with local signs , and the language that we know today as <unk> .
So it has a story about 200 years .
I was born deaf , and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life .
And I thought it was true .
But now I realize that it 's not true for anything .
The sounds are a very important part of my life , really , in my mind every day .
As a person who lives in a sound world , it 's like I lived in a foreign country , continuing to blindly follow their rules , customs , behaviors and <unk> standards .
So how do I understand sound ?
Well , I see how people behave and respond to sound .
People are like my speakers and they amplify sound .
So I 'm learning and <unk> that behavior .
At the same time , I 've learned that I can create sounds , and I 've seen how people respond .
So I 've learned , for example ...
`` Do n't shake the door ! ''
`` Do n't do a lot of noise to eat the potato bag ! ''
`` No <unk> , and when you 're eating , make sure not scratch the covered in the dish . ''
I call this `` sound tag . ''
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does .
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm always waiting for the sound of the sound that 's going to come next .
Hence this drawing .
<unk> , to decide .
<unk> , for continuing .
<unk> , to announce .
You can see that <unk> has no notes on the lines .
That 's because the lines contain sounds through subtle <unk> and spots .
In deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
This is the signal for `` <unk> '' in <unk> .
A typical <unk> has five lines .
However , to me , I 'm going to do that with my thumb that does n't feel natural .
That 's why I just have four lines on paper .
In 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artistic house there .
Before this time , I had worked as <unk> .
During this summer , I went to museums and <unk> spaces , and as I went from one place to another , I realized there were no visual art there .
At that time , the sound was the trend and that struck me .
There was no visual art , it was all auditory .
Now the sound has entered my territory of art .
Is it more of the art ?
I realized that it does n't have to be like this .
In fact , I know the sound .
I know it so well that it 's not only experienced through the ears .
I can feel it in a tactile way , or I can experience it visually , or even as an idea .
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice .
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound , I decided to leave it and <unk> .
I started creating a new body of work .
And when I presented it to the art community , I was shocked by the amount of support and attention that I received .
I realized that sound is like money , power , control , social currency .
In the background of my mind , I always felt that sound was alien , was something of a listener .
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artwork , or I could empower them .
I chose to get stuck .
There 's a mass culture around language spoken .
And just because I do n't use my literal voice to communicate , the eyes of society is like I had no voice at all .
So I have to work with people who can support me equally , and become my voice .
That way I am able to be relevant to the current society .
So in school , at work and institutions , work with many different performers from <unk> .
And your voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me to be heard .
And their voices have value and weight .
Ironically , by asking for your voices , I 'm able to maintain a temporary way of value , like taking a very high interest rate , like taking a very high interest rate .
If I 'm not going to continue on this practice , I feel that I could be <unk> in oblivion and not having any social value .
So , with sound like my new art medium , <unk> in the world of music .
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk> .
For example , a musical note can not capture and to express the paper fully .
And the same thing can be said for a concept in <unk> .
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> , which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals like the sounds .
I 'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for you to understand better how <unk> works .
So , imagine a piano .
<unk> is divided into many different <unk> parameters .
If you spread a difference to every finger , as your facial expression , the movement of the body , the speed , the shape of the body , the speed , the shape of the hand , the shape , the shape of the hand , English is a linear language , as if you get a key at the same time .
However , the <unk> is more like a chord , you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk> .
If just a key key would change the chord , it would create a completely different meaning .
Same thing happens with the music in terms of pitch and timbre and volume .
In <unk> , by using these different parameters , they can express different ideas .
For example , the <unk> sign on that .
This is the `` <unk> at that . ''
I 'm seeing you .
<unk> .
Oh , I 'm getting bored .
Uh oh .
What are you looking at ?
Ah , good !
So I started thinking , and if I see <unk> through music glasses ?
If I had to make a sign of it and pull it over and over again , it could be like a piece of visual music .
For example , this is the `` day '' sign , the sun comes out and puts it .
This is `` all day . ''
If you <unk> it and you slow it down , visually looks like a piece of music .
All day .
I feel like the same thing can say the same night .
`` All night . ''
This is all night , in this drawing .
And this led me to think about about three different types of nights : `` Last night , '' `` overnight , '' `` all night . ''
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two .
This represents what time is expressed in <unk> and how distance the body is able to express the changes in time .
For example , one <unk> . It 's a hand , two <unk> . It 's two hands , the present gets closer and in front of the body , the future is in front of the body , and the past is on the back .
So , the first example is , `` A long time ago . ''
Then , `` past . '' And the last one , which is my favorite , with a very romantic , dramatic idea at once , `` Once . ''
`` Time for '' is a musical term with a specific pace by compass by compass .
However , when I see the word `` ordinary time '' I think automatically in `` at the same time . ''
Look at <unk> : E : E : left hand .
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest .
[ Face : <unk> , <unk> , flashlight ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] : E , a flashlight -- I 'm going to show you a shape of the hand called a flashlight .
Can you do that with me ?
All the hands in high .
Now we 're going to do it both in the head like the chest , something like `` common time '' or `` at the same time . ''
Yeah , very well .
That means `` love '' in the international system .
The international system , as a note , is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the signs across the world .
The second one I 'd like to show you is this . Please do it with me again .
And now this is .
It means `` colonization . ''
Now , third . Please follow me again .
And again .
It 's `` lighting '' in <unk> .
We 're going to do the three together .
`` <unk> , '' `` colonization , '' and `` lighting . ''
Good job .
Notice how three signs are very similar . They all happen in your head and your chest , but they can actually make very different meanings .
It 's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and prosperous , just like music .
However , today , we live in a very <unk> world .
And just because the <unk> does n't have sounds , it does n't have social value .
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value , no sounds .
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society .
And maybe people will understand that you do n't have to be deaf to learn <unk> , you do n't have to hear about learning music .
<unk> is a treasure treasure , and I 'd like you to have the same experience .
I 'd like to invite you to open your ears , open your eyes , to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language .
And they never know , they can even fall in love with us .
Thank you .
Denise <unk> : Hey , that 's me .
As a child , my parents would tell me , `` You can <unk> everything , but then you have to <unk> it . ''
Freedom involves responsibility .
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places , where everything was possible .
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence , or a bubble of ignorance , I should say , because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth .
By getting older , I found out that the adults also <unk> and that they 're not very good at cleaning the others ' ones .
Time happened , now I 'm adult and I teach citizenship and invention at the <unk> school in Hong Kong .
You do n't need a lot to wait for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage .
So as good citizens , we cleaned up the beaches , and not drinking alcohol , and if he 's , I did n't give it .
It 's sad to say , but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic .
It 's a scary thing .
And in the last few decades , we 've been coming out with these big ships and networks , to collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope , and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map .
But it lasts for an eternity and it 's very expensive , and it 's also very risky to use those huge boats .
So with my students , with ages six to 15 years old , dream of inventing a better way .
We 've transformed our tiny room in Hong Kong in a workshop .
We started building this <unk> <unk> , so that the very <unk> children can also participate in .
And I 'll tell you , kids who manipulate electrical tools are great and secure .
Not exactly .
Let 's go back to plastic .
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean , which is very small , because of its fragmentation .
That 's what we do .
I 'll leave you with my imagination .
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to get it into something that we hope to work .
So we decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic , just <unk> information .
By using a robot , we take a picture of this plastic -- kids get very excited about robots .
And then we created quickly what we call `` prototype . ''
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch .
And we 'll transform light bulbs and chambers on accessories and we assemble it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there , and this is the image captured by the robot .
We see the bits of plastic floating through the sensor , as long as the computer on board process this image , and measure the size of every particle , to get a <unk> estimate of the amount of plastic in the water .
I <unk> this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called `` <unk> , '' with the hope that someone will get better even more .
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem , and boom , they 're trying to fix it immediately .
I can investigate my local problem , but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed .
You see the news , you get the Internet , and you 're going to get stuck with this image .
A child , maybe smaller than 10 years old , cleaning up a oil spill , just using the hands , in <unk> , the largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh .
They were very surprised because this is the water you drink , it 's the water that you bathe , the water where you are growing , the place where you live .
You can also see that water is brown , mud and oil are also brown color , and when everything gets together , it 's very difficult to see what 's in the water .
But there 's a simple technology called <unk> , which allows you to see what 's in the water .
We built a first prototype of a <unk> <unk> that can burn through all kinds of substances that produce different spectra , which can help you identify what 's in the water .
I <unk> this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh .
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem , or to look at a local problem , my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other children .
I can investigate a problem at a distance , I was forced to do a second experiment , and I wanted to go a little further , maybe I 'm going to tackle a harder problem , and also closer to me .
I 'm half Japanese and half French , and maybe remember , that in 2011 , there was a devastating earthquake in Japan .
It was so violent that the various giant waves , called tsunamis , and those tsunamis removed several cities on the East coast of Japan .
More than 14,000 people died in a moment .
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima , a nuclear station nearby to water .
And today , according to reports for the average 300 tons of being leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean .
Today , the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk> .
If we go to the west coast , we can measure the radiation of Fukushima everywhere .
But if you look at the map , it seems that most of the radiation 's left from the Japanese coast , and most of them , of course , looks at safe , is blue .
Well , reality is a little bit more complicated than that .
I 've come back to Fukushima every year from the crash and research independently with other scientists , the land , the river , and this time we wanted to bring kids .
Of course we did n't take them , the parents did n't let it .
But every night we reported the control center -- here you see the use of different masks .
It might seem like they did n't take the work seriously , but they did it because they 're going to have to live with her whole life .
Together with them we discuss the data that day , and we talk about what we were going to do next , the strategies , the kind of thing , and so forth .
And to do this , we created a <unk> <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant .
We created the elevation map , we introduced pigments to represent data in real time of radioactivity , and <unk> water to simulate the rain .
With this , we were able to notice that the radioactive powder was filtering from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> system in the ocean .
It was a rough estimate .
But based on this , we organized a civil expedition , the nearest to the date of nuclear power to date .
We get closer to a mile of the nuclear central , and with the fishermen help in the area , we went collecting the sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and build .
Here we see a progression : we 've gone from a local problem to a remote problem , to a global problem .
And it 's been very exciting to work on these different scales , also with open source technologies .
But at the same time , it 's been increasingly frustrating because we 've only been starting to measure the damage we 've done .
We have n't even begun trying to solve problems .
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things .
So the classroom became a little bit of so small , we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space , and we turned the social and environmental impact .
It 's in the middle of Hong Kong , and it 's a place where we can work with wood , metal , chemistry , a little bit of biology , of optical , basically , can be built almost everything there .
It 's also a place where adults and children can play together .
It 's a place where children 's dreams can become true with adults , and where adults can be children again .
Students : acceleration ! <unk> !
<unk> <unk> : We asked questions like , can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy ?
For example .
Or , can we help in movement of the elderly population by turning their standard <unk> chairs in new electric vehicles ?
<unk> , oil and <unk> are terrible <unk> , but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies .
We ca n't afford to protect the kids of the horrible truth , because we need their imagination to invent the solutions .
So , scientists , creators , <unk> , we need to prepare for the next generation so that they 're concerned about the environment and people , and so I can actually do something about it .
Thank you .
Two <unk> twin cultures , two different design cultures .
One is made from thousands of steel pieces , the other one of a single silk thread .
One of them is synthetic , the other organic .
One is imposes on the environment , the other one creates it .
One is designed by nature , the other one for her .
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the raw 7th , he saw a figure that struggle for being free .
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo .
But living things are not <unk> .
They grow .
And in the smallest units of life , cells , we take all the information that 's required for every cell to work and to replicate .
The tools also have consequences .
At least since the Industrial Revolution , the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production production .
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of parts , <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects like <unk> in discrete parts with different functions .
But you do n't find <unk> material in nature .
Think of human skin , for example .
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores .
The skins of the back are thicker with small pores with little pores .
You act primarily as the filter , the other mostly like barrier , and yet it 's the same skin , there 's no parts , there 's no <unk> .
It 's a system that moves gradually its functionality through variation of <unk> .
Here 's a divided screen that represents my view of the world divided , the double personality of every designer and architect to work today between the <unk> and the gene , between the machine and the organism , between the assembly and the growth , between Ford and Charles Darwin .
These two visions of the world , my left hemisphere and the right , <unk> and synthesis , is shown in the two screens after me .
My work , at the simplest level , tries to unite these two visions of the world , moving away from the assembly and getting into growth .
You 're probably wondering : Why now ?
Why was it not possible for 10 or even five years ?
We live in a very special moment in history , a rare moment , where they have all four disciplines that are giving designers access to tools that we never had access to before .
And at the intersection of these four fields , my team and I created .
Please know the minds and the hands of my students .
We 're designing objects , products , structures and tools across scales , large-scale structures , like this robotic arm at the order of 24 meters in diameter with a capability that someday not too far away to print entire buildings , and graphs to the nanoscale facts of genetically modified microorganisms .
So here we have <unk> the server , an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture , and it has created a screen where every aperture is unique size to shape the shape of light and the heat through it .
In our next project , we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt . This was for a fashion fashion fashion and a skirt . It 's like a second skin made from one piece , <unk> in the contours , flexible around the waist .
<unk> with 3D printing printing , we printed this layer and 3D skirt with no seams between cells . I 'll show you more objects like that .
This helmet combines <unk> and soft materials in the resolution of 20 microns .
This is the resolution of a human hair .
It 's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner .
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and synthetic instruments , allows us to design products that fit not just the shape of our bodies , but also the physiological structure of our tissues .
We 've also designed an acoustic chair , a <unk> chair , comfortable and also absorb sound .
Professor Carter , my collaborator , we went back to nature to inspire , and by designing this <unk> pattern , it becomes <unk> .
They 're going to take this surface of 44 different properties , which vary in stiffness , <unk> and color , <unk> the pressure points in the human body .
Its surface , like in nature , changes its functionality , not by addition from addition to another material or other assembly , but we 're continually <unk> and delicately the material ownership .
But is the ideal nature ?
Are n't there any parts in nature ?
I did n't grew up in a religious Jewish home , but when I was young , my grandmother told me stories about the Hebrew Bible stories , and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about .
As she says , `` In the third day of the Creation , God sends Earth to grow a tree , <unk> . ''
For that first tree , there would be no difference between trunk , branches , leaves and fruits .
The whole tree was a fruit .
Instead , the land made of growing trees with branches , cortex and flowers and flowers .
The earth created a world made of parts .
I often ask , `` What would be design if the objects were made of one piece ?
Do you <unk> a better state of creation ? ''
So we 're looking for the biblical material , the kind of material material , with fruit , and we found it .
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> , and about 100 million tons , they produce organisms as shrimp , crabs , scorpions and butterflies .
We think that if we could tune in to your properties , we could generate <unk> structures in one piece .
So that 's what we did .
We call it legal <unk> . We 're doing a lot of shrimp husks , the <unk> and produced toothpaste .
We <unk> chemical concentrations , we 've been able to achieve a wide range of properties , from dark , hard and opaque , to the light , soft and transparent .
To print the large-scale structures , we built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> nozzles .
The robot could vary the properties of the material around and create these structures made from a single <unk> material , 100 percent recyclable .
When the pieces are ready , it stops dry them to find a natural way into the air .
So why are we still designing with plastic ?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain microorganisms <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago , as we heard yesterday .
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT , <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar .
For the first time , we 've been able to generate structures that make structures that make their transition with no problems of beams online , and if it broadens even more , to windows .
A <unk> tree .
Working with an ancient material , one of the first forms of life on the planet , with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology , we 've transformed a structure of <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree .
And here is the best part : for <unk> objects , in the sea , <unk> the marine life , and placed on the ground , they will grow a tree .
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system .
We 're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for the <unk> trips .
To do that , we must dominate the bacteria and control their flow .
So , like the periodic table , we did our own elements of elements : new forms of life created <unk> , fabricated and <unk> form .
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid alchemy , only instead of <unk> metals , are synthesized in new biological functionalities into very small channels .
This field is called microfluidics .
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crop bacterial bacterial bacterial <unk> .
In our first piece of clothes , two microorganisms .
The first one is <unk> .
It lives in our oceans and the hot water ponds .
And the second , E. coli , the bacteria that inhabit in the human intestine .
One makes light in sugar , the other eats sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment .
But these two microorganisms do not interact in nature .
They never met .
They 're here , designed for the first time , to have a relationship in a piece of clothes .
Think of it as evolution , not by natural selection , but evolution by design .
In order to contain these relationships , we 've created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract , which will help you flow these bacteria and to bring these bacteria together .
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body , we will <unk> the properties of the material according to the functionality that we wanted .
If we wanted photosynthesis , we get more transparent channels .
This <unk> digestive digestive system , when they stretch from one end to another , and 60 meters .
This is half the length of a football field , and 10 times more than our thin intestine .
And here it is , as we 're going to see at TED , our first portable photosynthetic channels with life within clothes .
Thank you .
Mary Shelley he said , `` We are <unk> creatures , only half is made . ''
What if design would get the other half ?
What if we could create structures that will increase living matter ?
What if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin , we will make damaged tissue and hold our bodies ?
Think of this as a form of editing biology .
I call this material ecology .
For that , you always have to go back to nature .
Now , you know , a 3D printer printing material .
You also know that nature does n't do that .
It grows . <unk> with sophistication .
This cocoon of the worm , for example , creates a highly sophisticated architecture , a very sophisticated home in which they 're going to get away .
Now , manufacturing is n't <unk> about this level of sophistication .
It does it by combining not two materials , but two of the proteins in different concentrations .
One acts like structure , the other is the glue or the mater , together , together .
And this is going on through scales .
The silk worm first turns out in the environment , it creates a structure of tension , and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression .
<unk> and compression , the two forces of life , they manifest themselves in a single material .
So in order to understand better how this complex process works , we attach a small magnet to a silk worm , to row .
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm .
However , when you put the silk worm in a flat patch , not inside a box , we realized that you would go in a cocoon flat and still <unk> <unk> .
So we started designing different environments , different scaffolding , and we 've discovered that the shape , the composition , the structure of the cocoon , being passed directly by the environment .
They often get rid of silk worms to death inside their cocoons , their silk gets overhead and used in the textile industry .
We saw that designing these templates , we can give shape silk without boiling in cocoon .
It 's <unk> <unk> , and we could create these things .
So we actually got this process up to the architectural scale .
We had a robot <unk> doing some silk templates , and we put ourselves on our site .
We knew that silk worms are <unk> towards the darker and cool and cool and cool and cool , so we use a solar pathway to reveal the distribution of light and the heat in our structure .
So we created holes or <unk> , to block the rays from light and heat , distributes the worms on the structure .
We were ready for the caterpillars .
We <unk> atmospheres of silk to a online silk farm .
And after we feed four weeks , they were prepared to <unk> with us .
We put them carefully on the bottom of the scaffolding , and while <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , put eggs , and life begins again , like us , but much , much shorter .
Bucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity , and she was right .
By <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk silk , you give all this pavilion up .
And in a little bit over two or three weeks , atmospheres of silk worms pink miles away .
In a curious symmetry , this is also the length of the silk route .
<unk> , after <unk> , produce 1.5 million eggs .
This could be used for 250 pavilions in the future .
So here are the two visions of the world .
<unk> silk through a robotic arm , another full empty arm .
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings that surround us , to form an ecology of two materials , the designers must bring these two visions of the world .
Which brings us back , of course , at the beginning .
Here 's a new era of design , a new era of creation , that leads to a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of design , which demands of us , for the first time , that we take care of nature .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Raise your hand if you 've ever asked me , `` What do you want to be older ? ''
If you had to remember what age they were when they asked them for the first time ?
They can <unk> with your fingers .
Three . Five . Five . Five .
Now raise your hand if you ask , `` What do you want to be older ? ''
It has caused some kind of anxiety .
Any anxiety .
I 'm somebody who could never answer the question , `` What do you want to be older ? ''
The problem was n't that I had no interest , but I had too many .
In school , I liked English , kill and art and <unk> websites , and in addition , playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you 've heard about us .
And in general , I like to try and persist and persist anyway , for a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field .
But with time this feeling of boredom , this feeling of , this is no longer challenging , it gets to <unk> .
And I have to leave it .
But then I 'd come up with something else , which is completely different , and I 'm going to get stuck on it , and I 'm going to keep going , `` Yes ! I 've found my own , '' and then again this point where I start <unk> .
And finally , I want to leave it .
But then I 'd like to discover something new and different , and I 'd like to go into that .
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety , for two reasons .
The first was because I was n't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career .
I thought I had to choose one thing , to deny all of my other passions , and <unk> <unk> .
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal .
I was worried that there was something wrong with this , and something wrong with me did n't do anything .
I was worried about being afraid of engagement , or being dispersed , or <unk> or to my own success .
If you can relate my story and these feelings , I 'd like to ask you something that I 'd like to have been raised with you then .
Ask yourself , where they learned to allocate meaning of bad or abnormal to do things .
I 'll tell you where they learned : they learned about culture .
`` What do you want to be from greater ? ''
It 's about five years old .
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they 're going to do to that age .
It 's considered a naive question to make cute answers in the kids like , `` Being an astronaut '' or `` be a dancer , '' or `` I want to be pirate . ''
And I 'd come up with the Halloween departure here .
This question takes us over and over again , as we grow up in various forms , <unk> . <unk> , high school students are asked to pick up in college .
And at some point , `` What do you want to be older ? ''
It 's going to be the cute exercise of the before what is taking away the dream .
Why ?
Although this issue inspires kids to dream about what they might be , it does n't inspire to dream of everything they might be .
In fact , just the opposite , because when someone asks you what you want to be , you ca n't respond to 20 different things , even though well-intentioned adults might laugh and say , `` Oh , what 's cute , but you ca n't be a craftsman of violins and psychologist .
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Childs , and he 's a craftsman of violins and <unk> .
And this Amy Ng , he 's converted to <unk> , <unk> , teacher and creative principal .
But most children do n't hear about people like this .
All you hear is they 're going to have to choose .
But it 's more than that .
The notion of <unk> is very idealized in our culture .
It 's this idea of fate or the real calling , the idea that each one of us has something to engage in their time on this land , and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it .
But if you 're somebody who 's not connected in this way ?
What if there are lots of different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do ?
There 's no place for somebody like one in that frame .
And so you can feel only .
You can feel that there is no goal .
And you feel like there 's something wrong with you .
There 's nothing bad in you .
You 're a <unk> .
A <unk> is someone who has a lot of creative interests and creative activities .
It 's a breath for that .
It could help if it was divided into three parts : multiple , potential and <unk> .
You can also use other terms , you can use the same kind of idea , as a scholar , <unk> .
During the middle of the Renaissance , the ideal was , the ideal of them were fine in multiple disciplines .
Barbara <unk> refers to us as `` scanners . ''
You 're looking at any term you like or making yourself yourself .
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community , we ca n't agree with one identity .
It 's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you must beat .
But what I 've learned through talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are huge strengths as it is in this way .
Here are three superpowers .
One : ideas synthesis .
That is , the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new at the intersection .
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> expressed their shared interests in cartography , visualization data , and design , and design , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a company that creates geographically inspired jewelry .
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of the unique idea for his <unk> skills and experiences .
Innovation happens at intersections .
There comes new ideas .
And the <unk> , with all of their background , can access a lot of these points at intersection .
The second <unk> superpower is fast learning .
When we <unk> ourselves with something , we go to it .
We look at everything we can have in our hands .
We 're used to being beginners , because it 's so many times in the past , and this means that we 're less afraid to test new things and get out of our comfort zones .
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines , and we bring everything we 've learned to every new area that we pursue , so we rarely start from scratch .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> and an independent writer .
As a little pianist refined an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory .
Now , she 's the fastest known <unk> .
Before becoming a writer , <unk> was a financial planner .
He had to learn the youngest sales mechanics when he started their practices , and this ability helps to write compelling throws for editors .
It 's rarely a waste of time to go to what you 're attracted to , even if you 're at the end it drops .
It 's possible to apply that knowledge in a whole different field , in a way that you could n't have anticipated .
The third <unk> superpower is the adaptability . That is , the ability to transform whatever it is needed in a given situation .
Abe <unk> is sometimes director of videos , other , designer pages , sometimes a dating consultant , sometimes a teacher , and sometimes he would seem like James Bond .
It 's valuable because it does a good job .
He 's even more valuable because it can take diverse roles , depending on the needs of his customers .
Now , Fast Company Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development , to thrive in the 21st century .
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market , the ones that really <unk> .
<unk> of ideas , fast learning and adaptability : three skills where <unk> are very adept , and three skills that could be lost if they 're stressed to reduce their goals .
As a society , we have a great interest in foster care to be themselves .
We have complex , multidimensional problems right now , and we need creative thinkers to deal with them .
Let 's say it 's , in your heart , specialists .
They came from the belly knowing because they wanted to be neurosurgeons .
Do n't worry , there 's nothing wrong with you either .
In fact , some of the best teams make up in a specialist and a <unk> <unk> .
The specialist can dive deep down and put in practice ideas , and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project .
It 's a beautiful relationship .
But we should all be designing lives and careers that are <unk> with how we 're connected .
And unfortunately , the <unk> are largely encouraging them to simply give them more like their specialized peers .
Once I said this , if there 's one thing that you take from this talk , I hope it 's this : <unk> with the internal wiring , whatever it is .
If you 're a heart specialist , then you 're going to <unk> all the media .
That 's where you give the best of itself .
But for the <unk> in the room , including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes , I say , <unk> with their many passions .
Keep your curiosity on the rabbit <unk> .
<unk> the intersections .
We <unk> our internal wiring brings us into a more authentic and happy life .
And perhaps most importantly , <unk> , the world needs us !
Thank you .
In the year 1901 , a woman called <unk> took her to a psychiatric institution .
<unk> <unk> and I could n't remember even the most basic details of their life .
His doctor called <unk> .
<unk> , I did n't know how to help <unk> , but <unk> it until , unfortunately , she passed away in 1906 .
After his death , <unk> did an autopsy , and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> , of a guy who had never seen before .
The most surprising thing .
If I would have been alive today , we could n't give it more help than the one that she was giving her gave her extended years .
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer 's .
And <unk> <unk> , the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer 's disease .
So , of course , medicine has advanced a lot .
You 've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections , lots of treatments for cancer , antiretroviral drugs , <unk> for <unk> and much more .
But little progress has been done in Alzheimer 's disease .
I 'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer 's for over a decade .
So I think about this all the time .
Alzheimer 's now affects 40 million people around the world .
But by 2050 , it will affect 150 million , by the way , to include many of you .
If you 're expecting to live up to 85 or more , your ability to get Alzheimer 's is almost one of every two .
In other words , there 's the chance that you 're going to spend your year 's chance of having Alzheimer 's or helping to take care of a friend or be loved with Alzheimer 's .
In America alone , Alzheimer 's costs 200 billion dollars every year .
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer 's disease .
Today is the most expensive disease , and its cost required for five times in the year 2050 , as the generation is older the generation of the boom .
It may surprise you , but Alzheimer 's is one of the greatest medical challenges and our generation .
But it 's been relatively little to fight it .
Today , one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world , Alzheimer 's is the only one that can not prevent , cure or even slow down their development .
We understand less about Alzheimer 's disease , because we 've invested less time and money in the investigation of the same .
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer 's disease , despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer 's disease and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer .
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause : the lack of consciousness .
Because this is what days people know , but everybody should be : Alzheimer 's disease is a disease , and we can treat it .
For most of the last 114 years , everyone , even scientists , <unk> Alzheimer 's disease .
We think that it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging .
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to a Alzheimer 's patient to see the real physical damage by this disease .
In addition to unleashed a severe memory of memory and mental skills , the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer 's significantly reduced life expectancy , and it 's always deadly .
Remember , Dr. Alzheimer 's found <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago .
For nearly a century , we did n't know much about this .
Today we know that they 're made of protein molecules .
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami .
There are places on the paper they 're being held .
And when it folds right , these dots have got up inside .
But sometimes things go wrong , and some of these points remain outside .
So this makes the protein molecules to paste each other , forming groups that can form large plates and <unk> .
That 's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer 's brain .
We 've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how these dysfunction works .
There 's a lot of steps , and identifying what step step is complex , as a bomb defuse .
<unk> a wire could do anything .
<unk> people can make the bomb explode .
You have to find the right step that locks it , and then create a drug that does .
Until recently , mostly they have reduced the wires and expected the best .
But now there 's a diverse group of people , doctors , biologists , geneticists , physicists , physicists , engineers and mathematicians .
And together , we 've managed to identify a critical step in the process . Now you 're testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease .
Let me show you some of our last results .
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet .
Let 's look at some videos of what happened when these drugs were going on .
These are the healthy worms , and you can see that they move normally .
These worms , on the other hand , have molecules of protein that stick in between them , like in humans with Alzheimer 's .
And you can see that they 're clearly sick .
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage , then we see that they 're going to be <unk> and they live a normal life .
This is just a positive initial result , but research as this shows that Alzheimer 's is a disease that we can understand and cure .
After 114 years , there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years .
But in order that hope , by overcoming Alzheimer 's disease , we need help .
It 's not scientists like me , it 's about you .
We have to make sure that Alzheimer 's disease is a disease , and if we try , we can <unk> it .
In the case of other diseases , patients and their families have more research on the research , and they have the pressure on governments , pharmaceutical industry , over scientists and legislators .
That was essential to advance HIV treatment in the late '80s .
Today we see that same unit for overcoming cancer .
But Alzheimer 's patients often ca n't speak themselves .
And their families , the unseen victims , caregivers of their loved ones and night , they 're often too helpful to go out and advocate for change .
So , it really depends on you .
Alzheimer 's not , in most cases a genetic disease .
Everybody with a brain runs the risk .
Today , there are 40 million patients like <unk> , that they ca n't create the change they need for themselves .
<unk> talking for them , and help demand a cure .
Thank you .
I published this article in the New York Times Modern , in January of this year .
To fall in love with somebody , do this .
The paper is about a psychological study , designed to create romantic love in the lab , and from my own experience to try it myself one night of last summer .
So the procedure is pretty simple : Two strangers are <unk> to ask more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes .
Here 's a couple of questions of example .
Number 12 : If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill , what would it be ?
Number 28 : When was the last time you get to someone else ?
And only ?
<unk> , these are more personal .
Number 30 : I really like -- Tell your partner what you like to do or it -- I know very honest this time , and I gave things that you would n't have ever met .
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago , a detail really struck me , the <unk> <unk> had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the lab .
So , I was skeptical about this process of making romantic love , but , of course , I was also intrigued .
And when I had the occasion to test this study , with someone who knew not particularly well , I did n't expect to fall in .
However , we fell in love with , and I thought it was a good story , so I send them to the column love Modern , a few months later .
That was published in January , and now it 's August , so I guess some of you are probably wondering : Are they still ?
And the reason I think you 're asking this is because you 've done this question over and over the last seven months .
And this question is just what I want to talk about today .
But let 's go back to the subject .
A week before the paper was published .
I 'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years , so I 'd been encouraged to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog .
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views as a lot , and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and I figured that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views .
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship .
But he had no idea .
The paper was released on a Friday night , and on Saturday , this happened in my blog blog .
And Sunday , I had already called the Today Show . Show the Good <unk> America .
Within a month , the article got over eight million views , and I was , for saying something , little prepared for this kind of attention .
One thing is to foster trust with sincerity about their loved experiences , but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news , and that people all over the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship .
And when people were called or write , what they did every day for weeks , always , did the same question : Are they still together ?
In fact , when I was preparing this talk , I made a quick pursuit in the mailbox 's mailbox with the phrase , `` Are they still ? ''
And several messages came up immediately .
It was students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this .
I was interviewed with the radio and they asked him .
Even I gave a talk , and a woman shouted down to the stage , `` Hey <unk> where your boyfriend is ? ''
And I immediately got red .
I understand that this is part of the deal .
If you write about your relationship in an international journal , you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it .
But I was n't ready for the <unk> of the answer .
Now , 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life .
In fact , the New York Times published an complementary article for Valentine 's <unk> , who included the experience of readers by trying to test the study in different degrees of success .
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship .
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together .
It 's <unk> TV interviews , and I opted for pictures of us two .
I think I was afraid to become the icons in the <unk> icons of <unk> , a range for the one that I did n't feel at all qualified .
And I understand that people did n't want to know just if the study did n't want to know if the study worked , they wanted to know if it was able to produce <unk> love , not just an adventure , but real love , <unk> love .
But this was a question I did n't feel able to answer .
My relationship was just a few months old , and I felt , especially people said the wrong question .
How do we follow if we would follow it together or not , and then tell you ?
If the answer was not , would the experience of doing these 36 , less interesting questions ?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997 , and there , the research goal was not to produce romantic love .
Instead , I was looking at interpersonal focus between college students , using what Aron called <unk> , progressive , <unk> staff .
It sounds romantic , right ?
But the study does work .
The participants were more close to doing that , several studies later , used the protocol of <unk> protocol , as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers .
They 've used it between members of police and community , and they 've used it between people of the opposite political ideologies .
The original version of the story , which I did last summer , that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact , was cited in this article , but unfortunately he never published .
A few months ago , I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university , and then a student came to me and she said to me afterward , and she said to me afterwards : I tried to study the study and did n't work .
He seemed puzzled for it .
And I said , `` Do you mean to get you from the person who you did it ? ''
Well he did a pause .
I think she just wants us to be friends .
And I said , but became better friends ?
Did you feel that I did make better know after proving the study ?
The nodded .
So , it worked , '' I said .
However , I do n't think that was the answer that he was looking for .
In fact , I do n't think it 's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love .
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29 , and it was going through a really difficult separation .
I had had that relationship since I had 20 , which was practically all of my adult life , and he was my first true love , and he had no idea how or if I could live without him .
So I went to science .
And I did everything that I could find about the science of romantic love , and I expected that that could sort of get it in a way to break the heart .
I do n't know if I realized this at the time , I thought I just did I do research for the book that I was writing but in retrospect , it looks really obvious .
I thought , if I 've built me with knowledge of romantic love , I would never have to feel as bad as I felt like then .
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another .
I 'm more patient with love . I 'm more relaxed .
I have more confidence in demand what I 'm looking for .
But I can also see myself more clearly , and I can realize that what I 'm looking for is sometimes more than they can demand me to me .
What I 'm looking for love is an assurance , not only being loved tomorrow today and to be loved tomorrow , but to keep being loved indefinitely by the person I love .
It may be the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know if they were still together .
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to love .
There may be a way to create a way to mitigate some of the implicit risk , and this is a very appealing story , because in love to us feel beautifully , but it 's also scary .
But I think when it comes to love , we 're very willing to accept the short version of the story .
The story of the story that asks : Are they still together ?
And the content with an answer for me or not .
So more than a question , I would propose we do more difficult questions , questions like , how do you decide who you deserve your love and who do n't ?
How do you stay in love when things get tough , and how do you know when to cut and distance ?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship , or even more , how do you live with doubt from your partner ?
I do n't necessarily know the answers to these questions , but I think they 're a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone .
So , if you want the short version of my relationship , it 's this one -- a year ago , a known one and I applied a study designed to create romantic love , we fall in love with , we still follow together , and I 'm very happy .
But fall in love is not the same thing to stay in love .
<unk> is the easy part .
So at the end of my article I wrote : The love did n't happen .
<unk> in love , because we took the choice of being .
And I wince a little while reading it now , not because it 's not true , but because at the time , I had n't considered everything I was supposed to do .
I did n't think of how many times we 'd have the two to make that decision , and how much I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always pick up or not .
I want you to be enough to have done and respond 36 questions , you have chosen to love someone so generous , kind and fun , and you have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States .
But what I 've done , instead , is turning my relationship to the kind of myth that I do n't really believe .
And what I 'm looking for , and what maybe I 'm going to spend my life looking for is that that myth is true .
I want the happy implicit implicit implicit in the title of my article , which is , purpose , the only part of the article that I did n't really write .
But what I have instead is the opportunity to choose someone , and the hope that he also loved me , and it 's terrifying , but that 's the deal with love .
Thank you .
I was raised by a lesbian , and I was in a way , I became like a <unk> of the forest .
It was a while ago , something that really affected me , but more details later on .
I 'll start with when I was eight years old .
He took a wooden box , and he <unk> a dollar bill , a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado .
And I thought that some strange humanoid background or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species exchanging ideas , for example , how we eat spaghetti .
I had no idea .
Anyway , it 's funny because it 's funny because here I am , 30 years later , and I 'm still doing boxes .
At a moment I was in Hawaii -- I like to go out of tour and surf and all of those weird things -- and I was doing a collage for my mother .
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> , like Agnes Martin , wrapped it and a bee stuck .
Well , my mother is afraid of bees , and it 's <unk> to them , so I added more resin , thinking that I could do it .
Instead , the opposite happened : it somehow seemed to be growing up , as if I was getting the text with a magnifying glass .
So I did ? I built more boxes .
This time , I started adding electronics , frogs , strange bottles that I was finding out on the street , all I could find , because I was looking for things all my life , trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects .
So I started drawing around the objects , and I realized that God can draw in space .
I can flow <unk> , and I can draw the same way about a dead corpse on the crime scene .
And I took the objects up and created my own taxonomy of specimens invented .
First , <unk> -- that you can get an idea .
Then I made some insects and strange creatures .
It was very fun to draw in the resin layers .
And it was great , because I started building exhibitions and those things , and I was making some money , to bring my girlfriend for dinner , for example , going to <unk> .
It was great , man .
At some point I became interested in the human form , <unk> sculptures of human size with drawings of human beings within the layers .
It was great , except for one thing : I was dying .
I did n't know what to do , because the resin was going to kill me .
And I went to bed every night thinking about it .
So I tried to use glass .
I started drawing in the glass layers , similar to the drawing on a window , then another window , and another window , and I had all these windows together , that make a three-dimensional composition .
And this really worked , and so I could stop using the resin .
So I did this for years , and my work <unk> with something very big , that I call `` triptych . ''
The `` triptych '' inspired me , largely in `` The Garden of <unk> '' from Hieronymus Bosch , which is a painting in the <unk> Museum in Spain .
You know it ?
Well , it 's a fantastic picture .
They say it 's a little ahead of your time .
Well , the `` triptych . '' I 'm going to explain this piece .
It weighs 11 pounds .
A half feet long .
It 's got a <unk> , so it 's 10 meters of composition .
It 's a little bit weird .
Well , that 's the source of blood .
On the left , there is Jesus and <unk> .
There 's a cave where all these creatures with the heads of animals travel between two worlds .
They go out of the world of representation , to this so-called analog mesh mesh where they hide .
Here is where creatures with animals are heading to the <unk> , lists to kill themselves in mass <unk> in the ocean .
The ocean is composed of thousands of elements .
This is a bird god tied to a <unk> .
Billy Graham is in the sea ; the Horizon <unk> platform of <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> shelter , there are all kinds of rare things you can find if you look very well in the ocean .
Anyway , also a kind of <unk> .
It 's coming out of the ocean , and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand goes out .
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems a mythological being that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium .
So it 's a look like the `` triptych . ''
It 's a little bit of a narrative .
That 's the hand it spits out .
And then , when you go on the other side , it has a nose , like a bird rush , and it spits out clouds from this nose .
It also has a <unk> line of a snake line that joins the `` triptych . ''
Anyway , its tail does fire in fire on a volcano .
I do n't know why it happened .
Things that happen , you know .
Your tail ends up in a eyeball , made up from 1986 in 1986 .
Have you seen them ?
They did in the 1980s , as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists .
It brings me to my last project . This brings me to my last project .
I 'm in the middle of two projects : One is called `` <unk> . ''
It 's about a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings .
Each one is a file of our culture , through media and material to be encyclopedias , dictionaries or magazines .
But each one acts as a kind of archive in the form of being human , and they travel in groups of 20 , four or 12 at the time .
They 're like cells , they come together , they divide up .
And you can walk between them . It 's taking years .
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1,300 kilos of a human trapped inside .
This is a little cave at the chest .
That 's the head ; it 's the chest , you can <unk> the input .
I 'll come with you for the rest of the body : there 's a waterfall that comes out of the chest , and that it covers the penis or <unk> , or whatever it has , a kind of <unk> thing .
It 's a quick practice of these works because I ca n't get it for a long time .
We have layers , you can see .
This is a <unk> body in half .
This has two heads , and it 's communicating between the two .
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue .
There 's a little forest scene inside your cavity cavity .
Can you see it ?
Anyway , this talk is about these boxes , just like the boxes we live in .
We 're in a box , the solar system is a box .
This brings me to my last box .
It 's a brick box . It 's called <unk> <unk> .
Within this box there is a physicist , a neuroscientist , a painter , a writer , a writer , a radio emitter , a writer , a school , an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world , and a garden .
We <unk> the box and all the people in the inside hit each other as particles .
And I think that 's the way to change the world .
When you haul that out and the box that you 're living in .
And together we came to realize that we are all together in this , that this illusion that we 're different , these concepts of countries , from the borders , of religion , it does n't work .
We 're all really made of the same stuff and in the same box .
And if we did n't start to exchange those things with sweetness , obviously we 're going to die very soon .
Thank you very much .
What do they do when they hurt their head ?
They take an aspirin .
But for this pill that this pill has effect against pain , first goes through the stomach , the intestines and other organs .
I 'm going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug that would be broken in your body .
The underdog , however , is that by <unk> any drug is dilute .
And this is a big problem , especially in HIV patients .
When they take antiretroviral drugs , these serve the amount of viruses in the blood , and increase the <unk> cell count .
But they are also known for their adverse side effects , mostly negative people , because in the time that it takes to get to the blood stream , they will become <unk> , and worse at the time that it takes to get to your destination , which is where it 's more important : in the HIV pool .
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes , the nervous system , the lungs , where the virus is dead , and it does n't easily go into the bloodstream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs .
Yet after the treatment of treatment , the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells .
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a treatment of life treatment for life .
One day , I sat down , and I thought , `` Could we do the treatment of treatment directly by the virus , without the risk of transformative ? ''
As a scientific scientist in lasers , the answer was in front of me : lasers , of course .
If you 're used in dentistry , for care of wounds and diabetes surgery , you can be used for anything you can imagine , including <unk> transportation .
In fact , we 're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes , opening and closing holes immediately the cells with HIV to introduce drugs .
You ask , `` How is that possible ? ''
We sent a powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane of HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug .
The laser goes through the cell , while the cell is absorbs the drug at a question of microseconds .
Before you even notice , the hole is immediately <unk> .
We 're testing this in vitro technology or in Petri plates , but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body , applying it to the human body .
`` How is that possible ? '' You can ask .
Well , the answer is , through a three head device .
With the first head , which is our laser , we will make an incision in the infection of infection .
The second head , which is a camera , is directed the infection .
Finally , the third head , a <unk> that distributes the drug , releases it into the infection of infection , while the laser is used again to keep the cells open .
Well , this does n't seem a lot of time .
But one day , if it 's successful , this technology can lead to the total of HIV HIV .
Yeah . A cure for HIV .
This is the dream of every research researcher -- in our case , a laser treatment .
Thank you .
In the last decade , I 've studied to non-state groups , state organizations like terrorists , insurgents and militias .
They run what these groups do when they 're not shooting .
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence agents and study ways of encouraging violent participation to nonviolent confrontation .
I do field work , in the world of politics and the library .
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything conflict , because the war has changed .
It used to be a dispute between states .
No .
Now it 's a conflict between states and non-state actors .
For example , from <unk> peace agreements between 1975 , and 2011 , <unk> was signed between a state and a non-governmental actor .
So we have to understand these groups , and we have even engage or <unk> in any kind of resolution of successful conflicts .
But how do you do that ?
We need to know what motivates these organizations .
We know very well the reasons why they fight , how they do it , but no one analyzes what they do when they do n't fight .
The armed struggle and policies are related to it .
It 's all part of the same organization .
We ca n't understand these groups , not much less <unk> , without a global view .
<unk> groups are complex organizations .
For example , Lebanese , Lebanese , known for his violent list against Israel .
From its creation in the 1980s , <unk> has also set up a political party , a social game network and a military system .
Similarly , <unk> Hamas , known for his suicide attacks against Israel , also runs the Gaza Bank since 2007 .
So these groups make more than simply shooting .
They 're multitasking .
They <unk> a complex machine : radio stations , TV channels , Internet websites , Internet websites and strategies in social networks .
And here you have the ISIS magazine , printed in English and published for recruitment .
armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising funds , but using profitable business , for example , building companies .
These activities are key .
They allow these groups to increase their strength , increase their funds , to recruit better and build their brand .
<unk> groups also do something else : they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services .
They build schools , they run hospitals , they set up the professional training programs .
<unk> offers all these services and more .
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state does n't give : security and protection .
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan ripped away by the war , or even the beginning of the rise of ISIS , can be understood as the efforts of these groups for delivering security .
Unfortunately , in these cases , security has a high price high cost for the population .
But in general , providing social services means filling a vacuum , a <unk> gap by the government , and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power .
For example , the electoral victory of 2006 from <unk> <unk> can not be understood without recognize the social work of the group .
It 's a really complex scenario , even in the West , when we look at the armed groups , we just think of the violent side .
But that 's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups , the strategy or vision for long-term vision .
These groups are hybrids .
They grow because they fill gaps left by government , and they emerge like armed and political groups , participate in violent struggle and give governance .
And the more complex and sophisticated the other organizations are these organizations , less we can do it as something else to a state .
How do I call a group like <unk> ?
<unk> part of a territory , run all their functions , collect the trash , run the sewer system .
Is it a state ? Is it a rebel group ?
Or maybe it 's something else , something new and different .
And what is ISIS ?
The lines were <unk> .
We live in a world of states , of nations without state and hybrids , and the weaker people are the states , like in the Middle East , more come in and fill that gap the non-governmental actors .
This is important for governments , because to counteract these groups , they will have to invest more in the tools that are not military .
It 's going to take that gap of governance has to be at the center of any sustainable approach .
This is very important also to establish and to make peace .
If we understand better the armed groups , we will better understand what incentives to provide to foster the transition from violence to violence .
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors , military power can win some battles , but we wo n't give us peace and stability .
To achieve these targets , we need long-term investments to fill that safe solution to fill that gap of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle .
Thank you .
I 'm a failure as a woman , as a feminist .
My views of gender equality are <unk> , but I 'm afraid to make openly the feminist label would be unfair for feminist .
I 'm a feminist , but pretty bad .
And so I 'd become a bad feminist .
Or , at least , I wrote an article , and a book called `` The profanity , '' and then in the interviews , people started calling me the <unk> <unk> .
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a provocation , it has become bigger .
Let me take a step back .
When I was young , especially in my youth , for 20 years , I had strange ideas about feminist , these <unk> women , anger with the men and hated sex . Like that was bad .
Today , I see how women are being treated worldwide and anger , in particular , seems like a perfectly reasonable response .
But at that time , I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> who could be a feminist .
Being labeled a feminist was an accusation , a taboo and unpleasant word .
I <unk> as a woman who does n't follow the rules , that she asks too much , with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it 's equal or higher to a man .
Nobody wants to be that rebel woman , until it realizes that it 's actually that woman , and it ca n't imagine being another person .
Over time , as I grew up , I started to accept that I am , in fact , feminist , and also , proud to be .
For me , certain claims are <unk> : women are equal to men .
It <unk> the same wages for the same job .
We have right to travel around the world like <unk> , free or violence .
We have right to use it very easy to use contraceptives and reproductive services .
We have the right to decide about our bodies , without the need for legislative controls or doctrines to <unk> .
We have the right to respect .
There 's more .
When you talk about the needs of women , you have to have to account our other identities .
We 're not just women .
We 're people with a different body , expression of gender , religion and sexuality , and sexuality and sexuality , and much more .
We have to have in mind these differences and how they affect us , in the same way that matters what we have in common .
Without these kinds of inclusion , our feminism is nothing .
For me , these truths are evident , but to be clear : I 'm a mess .
I 'm full of contradictions .
There 's a lot of things that do a bad feminist .
I have another confession .
When I lead to work , I hear rap music <unk> .
Although the lyrics degrades women and offends me deeply , the classic <unk> , the classic <unk> Council is amazing .
`` Do it with your wet t-shirt .
<unk> , let 's move it until the shell stops ! ''
Think about it .
<unk> poetry , right ?
I 'm completely mortified for my musical taste .
I firmly believe in man 's work , which is everything I do n't want to do , including -- all the household tasks , but also killing insects , the garbage collection , the <unk> and the maintenance of <unk> .
I do n't want to have anything to do with that .
The pink is my favorite color .
And the fashion magazines and the nice things .
I can see `` The <unk> , '' and the romantic comedies , and I have an <unk> fantasies of the fairy tales that are true .
Some of my crimes are more <unk> .
If a woman wants to adopt her husband 's name , it 's his choice , and I 'm not who I 'm going to judge .
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children , I accept that choice , too .
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same choice , the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they choose .
<unk> this problem .
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> the needs of women of color , the hardworking and gay women , for white women , heterosexual , middle class .
Listen , if that 's good feminism , I 'm a very bad feminist .
Also , the next thing : As a feminist , I feel a lot of pressure .
We have this tendency to put highlighted on a pedestal .
We hope to make perfection .
When we <unk> , we take a lot of taste from the same pedestal where we put them .
As I said , I 'm a mess ; I 'm a disaster -- I think I 'm going to stand up with that pedestal before you try to put up there .
Too many women , particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector , are afraid of being tagged as feminist .
They 're afraid to stand up and say , `` Yes , I 'm a feminist , '' for fear of what that tag means , for fear of not being able to be able to do with <unk> expectations .
Let 's take a example for example , or like I call it , the Goddess .
Over the last few years , it 's a <unk> feminist .
In the Video 2014 <unk> 2014 , MTV , acted in front of the word `` feminist '' <unk> .
It was a magnificent show , to see this pop star embracing this feminism star , and to know the women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of .
<unk> , the cultural critics start endless arguments if they were <unk> or not the feminist .
I was a feminism , rather than just believe the word of a grown and mature woman .
<unk> perfection of feminist , because we 're still struggling for a lot , we want a lot , we need so freaking out .
We go much beyond the sane and constructive criticism , to <unk> the feminism of any woman , wreck it until there is nothing left .
We do n't need to do that .
Feminism , or rather , a more inclusive feminism , is the point of starting .
But what happens next ?
We went from recognizing our imperfections to account , and to be a little bit more courageous .
If I hear demeaning music , I 'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy that providing an unlimited supply .
These artists will not change their way to speak about women in their songs until they <unk> the change actually affecting the profit .
It 's certainly hard .
Why do you have your music to be so <unk> ?
It 's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice .
But when bad decisions justify this , it makes it harder for women to achieve equality , the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility .
I think of my nieces , three and four years old .
These are two great , <unk> , bright girls , and also very brave .
Where they were being told by the strong creatures that are .
I think of them , all of a sudden , the best option is in place as something much easier to do .
We can all make better decisions .
We can change the channel when a television program tries to sexual violence against women like sports , we 'll take the <unk> Game .
We can change the radio emitter when we hear songs that treat women like nothing .
We can spend our money to go to film elsewhere when movies do n't treat women more than as decorative objects .
We can stop supporting the professional sports companies where athletes treat their peers as <unk> .
In any case , men , especially white men , especially white men , can say , `` No , I 'm not going to publish in your magazine , participate in your project , or work with you , until it does n't include a number of women , so much to participate in the way they make decisions .
I 'm not going to work with you until your publication , or your organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people . ''
Those of us who are <unk> , but invited us to participate in these kinds of projects , we can also be able to become even more as us welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision .
Because we 're not homeless <unk> . Without these efforts , without taking these positions , our accomplishments will mean very little .
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will arrive at the top , the people in the power directors and movie producers and music , CEOs , the legislators , the people who can make great decisions , more brave , to create a lasting change and significant .
We can also tell our feminism , well , bad , or whatever .
The last line of my book `` Bad <unk> , '' says , `` I 'm thinking a bad feminist to not be at all . ''
This is true because of a lot of reasons , but I say it , especially , because I was in the ancient days , I was stolen and the feminism helped me with it .
There was an incident .
I call it an incident to address what happened .
A few boys were <unk> when I was very young , and I did n't know that kids can do this to a girl .
I was treated as if it was nothing .
I started believing it was nothing .
I <unk> my voice , and after everything I did n't dare believe that I could say something that might matter .
But I was writing .
And I went back to <unk> .
I became a stronger version of myself .
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine , and of the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have brown skin .
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was n't anything .
I learned how to write like them , and then I learned how to write like myself .
I found my voice again , and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure .
Through the writing and feminism , I also found that if I was a little brave , another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us we are .
In one hand , I have the power to achieve anything .
And in the other , I hold the humiliating reality that I 'm just a woman .
I 'm a bad feminist , I 'm a good woman , I 'm trying to improve my way of thinking , what I say , and what I do , without abandoning everything that makes me human .
I hope we can all do the same thing .
I hope that we could all be a little brave , when you need to make a courage .
Just after Christmas last year , <unk> children in California had been measles for Disneyland or being exposed to someone who had been there .
The virus then went through the border to Canada , infecting more than 100 children in Quebec .
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles may be fatal for a child with a weakened immune system , it is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world .
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than a half century , but many of the children involved in the Disneyland outbreak were not immunized because their parents were afraid of something supposedly worse : autism .
But a moment , was n't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines , disqualified and marked by being an intentional fraud by the British Medical Journal ?
Do n't think most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a stupidity ?
I think most of you know , but millions of parents around the world continue to argue that vaccines to put them in danger to their children of autism .
Why ?
Here 's why .
This is a graph of the increasing estimates of autism in time .
For most of the 20th century , autism was considered a very rare disease .
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her , they believed to develop his entire professional life without seeing one case .
For decades , prevalence of prevalence continued stable only three or four children per 10,000 .
But then , in the 1990s , the numbers started <unk> .
<unk> organizations like <unk> are refer to autism as an epidemic , as if you could catch up another child at Disneyland .
What 's going on ?
If you 're not the vaccines , what is it ?
If you ask people from the <unk> Center for Disease Control , what 's going on , they tend to based on phrases like `` <unk> diagnostic criteria , '' and `` better detection , '' to explain these growing numbers .
But that kind of language does n't dissipates the fear of a young mother who seeks the face of his two-year-old son , the visual contact .
If the diagnostic criteria had to be a broader , why were they so tight at the beginning ?
Why were those cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of 1990 ?
Five years ago , I decided to figure out the answers to these questions .
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and cautious of science that with the seductive power of storytelling .
For most of the 20th century , doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered , but that story turned out to be false , and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health .
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinic literature .
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go .
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist , Leo <unk> , at Johns Hopkins Hospital : In 1943 , <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds , <unk> people around them , even to their own parents .
They could have fun for the hands by waving their hands on their faces , but they were prey to panic because they do n't put their favorite toy on their usual place without knowing them .
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic , <unk> speculated that autism is very rare .
For the 1950s , as a major authority of the world on the subject , I declared that it had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as they would pick up references as far as South Africa to South Africa .
This is not surprising , because the <unk> criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk> .
For example , I will give you that diagnosis for children with seizures , but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism .
Once he had become , he had turned to nine out of every 10 children sent out for other doctors to his office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism .
<unk> was a smart man , but part of his theories were not <unk> .
<unk> autism as a form of child psychosis caused by cold , cold parents .
These kids , he said , they 've been very carefully kept on a refrigerator that they did n't .
At the same time , though , I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that put together in certain areas like music , mathematics and memory .
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before they turned two .
When his mother put one of his favorite records , he said , `` Beethoven . ''
But he had a bad opinion of these skills , claiming things like the kids were simply telling them what they had heard their parents , <unk> , desperate to win their approval .
As a result , autism became a source of shame for families , and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good , turning into invisible to the world in general .
Surprisingly , it was n't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was rare .
<unk> <unk> , London psychologist in London , thought that the <unk> mothers ' theory was pretty stupid .
She and her husband was warm and <unk> and <unk> , and they had an deep autistic daughter called Susie .
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl , without support , without access to other resources without diagnosis .
To defend the National Service that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families , <unk> and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be 30 years earlier .
They launched a prevalence of autism prevalence in the general population .
We <unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community .
What they saw clear that the <unk> model was too limited , because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse .
Some children could not speak at all , whereas others were <unk> on their fascination for astrophysics , on the dinosaurs or they were <unk> <unk> .
Otherwise , these kids did n't fit into beautiful squares and <unk> , as Judith says , Judith , and saw a lot of them , much more than the monolithic model of <unk> would have predicted .
At first , they were lost for trying to make sense of their data .
How did n't you notice these kids before ?
But then I found a reference to a article that was published in German in 1944 , the next year to the <unk> article , and then I forgot , buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember .
I knew about this article about the competition , but I avoided <unk> that in his own work .
There was n't even an English translation , but luckily , the husband of <unk> spoke German , and he translated it to her .
The document offers an alternative story of autism .
His author was a man named Hans Asperger , who was leading an integrated clinic with a boarding school in Vienna in the 1930s .
So the ideas of Asperger 's training with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards .
The morning in their clinic started classes with music , and the kids would follow their games for the afternoon .
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism , Asperger 's as disability as a <unk> disability , that required forms of support forms of support and <unk> spaces throughout the course of life .
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients , Asperger 's calling them their little teachers , and he started helping the development of education that were especially suited for them .
Essentially , Asperger 's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts and disability .
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common , and they always have been , seeing aspects of this continuum in archetypes known in the <unk> culture , and the awkward teacher .
He went beyond even to say , that for success in science and art , an example of autism is essential .
And Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> , as well as the parents were <unk> .
Over the course of the next few years , they worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to expand the diversity of the diagnosis that they called `` autistic spectrum . ''
By the end of the '80s and the early '90s , their changes in place in place , by replacing the limited model of <unk> by a broad and inclusive range of Asperger .
These changes did n't fell in bag .
Now , when I was <unk> and Judith worked in the scenes to reform these criteria , people all over the world see an autistic adult for the first time .
Before `` Rain Man '' in 1988 , just a small circle , <unk> of experts knew what autism was , but after the very popular performance of Dustin Hoffman as Raymond <unk> and `` Rain Man '' and `` Rain Man , '' with the <unk> Academy , pediatricians , psychologists , teachers and parents around the world knew what autism was .
At the same time , the first clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism .
I did n't have to have a connection to that little circle of experts to make a diagnosis for his son .
The combination of `` Rain Man '' the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect , a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism .
The number of diagnoses began by rising , just like they predicted <unk> and Judith , in fact they hoped that it was , that it is , for people with autism and their families finally raise the support and services that were deserved .
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in diagnostics , and a simple , powerful history and seductive credible history as bad as the <unk> theory of autism was <unk> .
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 child in America are right , right , autistic are one of the largest minority groups in the world .
Over the last few years , autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for the new medical advances , the <unk> the term `` <unk> '' to celebrate the varieties of human cognition .
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems .
The fact that a PC does n't work with Windows , it does n't mean that it 's broken .
According to autistic standards , the normal human brain is easily <unk> , social spaghetti , and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail .
Certainly , autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them .
70 years later , we 're still reaching Asperger , who believed that the cure for the most immersive aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers , employers with capacity , support communities , and parents with faith in the potential of their children .
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> said once , `` We need all the hands on deck for <unk> the boat of mankind . ''
As we browse to an uncertain future , we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society .
We ca n't afford to waste or a brain .
Thank you .
